The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body.
The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The current champion is France, which won its second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.
The current format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 32 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over about a month.
The 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight national teams. Brazil have won five times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, France, and inaugural winner Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and Spain, with one title each.
The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed single sporting event in the world. The cumulative viewership of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet.''
17 countries have hosted the World Cup. Brazil, France, Italy, Germany, and Mexico have each hosted twice, while Uruguay, Switzerland, Sweden, Chile, England, Argentina, Spain, the United States, Japan and South Korea (jointly), South Africa, and Russia have each hosted once. Qatar will host the 2022 tournament, and 2026 will be jointly hosted by Canada, the United States,
and Mexico, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to host games in three World Cups.

Cinderella is a 1950 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney.
 Based on the fairy tale of the same name by Charles Perrault, it is the 12th Disney animated feature film.
 The film was directed by Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, and Clyde Geronimi.
 Mack David, Jerry Livingston, and Al Hoffman wrote the songs, which include "Cinderella", "A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes",
 "Oh, Sing Sweet Nightingale", "The Work Song", "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo", and "So This is Love".
 It features the voices of Ilene Woods, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton, Rhoda Williams, James MacDonald, Luis van Rooten, Don Barclay,
 Mike Douglas, William Phipps, and Lucille Bliss.
During the early 1940s, Walt Disney Productions had suffered financially after losing connections to the European film markets due
 to the outbreak of World War II.
 Because of this, the studio endured box office bombs such as Pinocchio, Fantasia, and Bambi, all of which would later become
 more successful with several re-releases in theaters and on home video.
 By 1947, the studio was over $4 million in debt and was on the verge of bankruptcy.
 Walt Disney and his animators returned to feature film production in 1948 after producing a string of package films with the
 idea of adapting Charles Perrault's Cendrillon into an animated film.
After two years in production, Cinderella was released by RKO Radio Pictures on February 15, 1950.
 It became the greatest critical and commercial hit for the Disney studio since the first full-length animated film Snow
 White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and helped reverse the studio's fortunes.
 It received three Academy Award nominations, including Best Music, Original Song for "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo".
Decades later, it was followed by two direct-to-video sequels, Cinderella II: Dreams Come True (2002) and Cinderella III:
 A Twist in Time (2007), and a 2015 live-action adaptation directed by Kenneth Branagh.
 The castle featured in the film has become an icon of The Walt Disney Company, serving as a basis for the production
 logo of Walt Disney Pictures. A real life construction of the castle was built at the Magic Kingdom park at Walt Disney World,
 as well at Tokyo Disneyland.

In 1720, while sailing to Port Royal, Jamaica aboard HMS Dauntless, Governor Weatherby Swann, his daughter Elizabeth and crew encounter a shipwreck and recover a boy, Will Turner.
 Elizabeth discovers a golden pirate medallion around his neck, and takes it.
 Eight years later, Lieutenant James Norrington is promoted to commodore and proposes to Elizabeth.
 Her corset makes her faint and fall into the sea, causing the medallion to emit a pulse. Captain Jack Sparrow, having just arrived in Port Royal to commandeer a ship, rescues Elizabeth.
 Norrington identifies Jack as a pirate, and a chase ensues. Jack encounters Will, now a blacksmith.
 They duel, and Jack is imprisoned. That night, the Black Pearl attacks Port Royal, searching for the medallion.
 The crew of the Pearl captures Elizabeth, taking her to meet Captain Barbossa.
 Elizabeth claims her last name is Turner to conceal her identity as the governor's daughter.
 Barbossa explains that the medallion is one of 882 gold pieces that his crew took from a treasure of Hernán Cortés on Isla de Muerta.
 This cursed Barbossa and his crew, turning them into immortals who appear skeletal in moonlight.
 Barbossa and his crew have returned all but one of the pieces, with Elizabeth's medallion being the final piece.
 Barbossa takes her prisoner, believing she is the daughter of William "Bootstrap Bill" Turner, whose blood is needed to lift the curse.
Will frees Jack to rescue Elizabeth, whom Will loves.
 Jack, the previous captain of the Black Pearl before Barbossa staged a mutiny, makes a deal with Will to reclaim his ship.
 The two commandeer HMS Interceptor, a small sloop-of-war, and head for Tortuga. There, Jack enlists Gibbs to help them assemble a crew.
 Chasing the Pearl to the Isla de Muerta, Will and Jack witness Barbossa sacrificing Elizabeth's blood and returning the final gold piece.
 The curse is not lifted because Elizabeth does not carry the blood of Bootstrap Bill, Will's father and a previous crewmate of the Pearl.
 Will rescues Elizabeth and brings her to the Interceptor, while Jack is captured by Barbossa and locked in the brig of the Pearl.
 The Pearl pursues the Interceptor, destroying the ship and taking Jack's crew hostage.
 Will makes a deal with Barbossa to release Elizabeth in exchange for his blood, but Barbossa exploits a loophole in the agreement, marooning Jack and Elizabeth on an island.
 Elizabeth makes a smoke signal, and Norrington brings the Dauntless to rescue Elizabeth and arrest Jack.
 Elizabeth asks Norrington to pursue the Pearl and save Will, convincing him by accepting Norrington's marriage proposal.
That night, the Dauntless arrives at Isla de Muerta.
 Jack tells Norrington he will lure the pirates out to be ambushed by the crew of the Dauntless, but instead persuades Barbossa's crew to attack the Dauntless before they lift the curse and lose their immortality.
 Elizabeth escapes the Dauntless and frees Jack's crew from the brig of the Pearl.
 They refuse to rescue Jack and Will, so Elizabeth sets out on her own while Jack's crew depart aboard the Pearl.
 Jack again switches sides, freeing Will and dueling Barbossa, while Elizabeth and Will fight off Barbossa's crewmen.
 When Barbossa stabs Jack, it is revealed that Jack took a piece of gold from the chest and is likewise cursed and unable to die.
 Jack shoots Barbossa, and Will returns both coins to the chest with his and Jack's blood on them.
 The curse is lifted; Barbossa dies from Jack's gunshot, and the rest of Barbossa's crew, no longer immortal, are arrested.
At Port Royal, Jack is to be hanged for piracy.
 Elizabeth diverts Norrington's attention while Will attempts a rescue, but Jack and Will are surrounded.
 Elizabeth intercedes and declares her love for Will. Governor Swann pardons Will and gives his blessing for Elizabeth to marry him.
 Jack dives into the sea and escapes aboard the nearby Pearl, reclaiming the ship and his new crew.
 Norrington permits Jack and the Pearl "one day's head start" before initiating pursuit.

In a world populated by anthropomorphic vehicles, the final race of the Piston Cup begins a rivalry between retiring veteran Strip "The King" Weathers, frequent runner-up Chick Hicks, and rookie sensation Lightning McQueen.
 At the back of the field, McQueen avoids a multi-car crash caused by Chick.
 While the rest of the running competitors pit for new tires under the pace car, McQueen stays out but blows out both rear tires on the last lap.
 Chick and the King catch up, resulting in a three-way tie.
 The tiebreaker race is scheduled for one week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway.
 McQueen is desperate to win the race, not only to be the first rookie to win the Piston Cup, but also because it would allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-Eze, a bumper ointment company, and take
 The King's place on the prestigious Dinoco team. However, he struggles to work with others due to his selfishness, which has caused him to fire three crew chiefs and having his pit crew quit after the race.
Eager to get to California as soon as possible, he pushes his big rig, Mack, to travel all night long.
 While McQueen is sleeping, Mack nods off and is startled awake by a gang of tuner cars, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road.
 McQueen wakes up in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway in search of Mack, but instead ends up in the rundown desert town of Radiator Springs, where he is chased by Sheriff and inadvertently damages the pavement of the main road.
 The next day, McQueen is ordered by the town judge and medical doctor, Doc Hudson, to leave town immediately, but the local lawyer, Sally, requests that McQueen should instead be assigned community service to repave the road by a machine, to which Doc reluctantly agrees.
 In a rush to leave, McQueen repaves the road shoddily. However, Doc is not satisfied, and he challenges McQueen to a race around Old Willie—if McQueen wins, he can leave.
 McQueen loses and is forced to start all over again.
During this time, he begins to warm up to the town and befriends several of its residents, including tow truck Mater, tire vendor Luigi, and his assistant Guido.
 He learns that Radiator Springs was once a popular stop along U.S. Route 66 until it was bypassed with the construction of Interstate 40 and mostly forgotten, and Doc was the Fabulous Hudson Hornet, a three-time Piston Cup champion whose career ended from a devastating crash in 1954.
 He bonds with Sally, who found happiness when she gave up a fast life in Los Angeles to live in Radiator Springs, and now dreams of putting the town back on the map.
 McQueen eventually repairs the road, reinvigorating the town's residents, and decides to spend an extra day in Radiator Springs with his new friends, but his time there is cut short when Mack and the media (including helicopters) descend on the town.
 McQueen reluctantly leaves to reach California in time for the race.
 At the same time, the brokenhearted Sally expresses her disappointment with Doc upon discovering that he was responsible for tipping off the media to McQueen's whereabouts.
 She and the others, dismayed about the departure of their new friend, go to sleep, while Doc quickly regrets his actions.
As he couldn't say goodbye to his friends at the race, McQueen races distractedly and ends up with one lap behind.
 He is then surprised to discover that Doc, having a change of heart, has taken over as his crew chief, and most friends from Radiator Springs are helping in the pit.
 Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen manages to recover and vaults into the lead.
 On the final lap, Chick performs a PIT maneuver and sends The King into a dangerous crash.
 Recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line and drives back to push The King over the line to finish his last race while Chick zooms by.
 As a result, the angered crowd and media condemn Chick's victory but praise McQueen's sportsmanship.
 Tex offers McQueen the Dinoco sponsorship, but he declines and insists on staying with Rust-Eze out of loyalty for their past support.
 Back at Radiator Springs, McQueen reunites with Sally and announces that he will be setting up his racing headquarters there, putting the town back on the map.
In a post-credits scene, Minny and Van, a couple trying to find the Interstate, are shown lost in the middle of the desert.

Dastan, a street urchin in Persia, is adopted by King Sharaman after showing courage.
 Fifteen years later, the king's brother Nizam relays evidence to the princes—Dastan, along
 with the king's biological sons Tus and Garsiv—that the holy city of Alamut is forging weapons for Persia's enemies.
 Tus directs the Persian army to capture Alamut. Dastan and his friends breach the city and open a gate for the siege.
 During the attack, Dastan defeats a royal guard and takes from him a sacred dagger.
Alamut falls to the Persians, but Princess Tamina denies that the city has any weapon forges.
 Tus asks her to marry him to unite the two nations, and she only accepts after seeing the dagger in Dastan's possession.
 At their celebratory banquet, Tus has Dastan give their father an embroidered robe.
 However, the robe is poisoned, fatally burning Sharaman. Garsiv accuses Dastan of the king's murder, but Dastan escapes with Tamina.
 Tus is appointed king and a bounty on Dastan’s head is set.
While in hiding, Tamina attempts to kill Dastan and steal the dagger, and in the struggle Dastan discovers the dagger enables
 the wielder to travel back in time. Dastan concludes that Tus invaded Alamut for the dagger, and decides to confront his brother
 at the funeral of the king in Avrat. On the way, the two are captured by merchant-bandits led by Sheik Amar who seeks the reward money, but they manage to escape. After arriving in Avrat, Dastan tries to convince Nizam of his innocence. Seeing burns on Nizam's hands, Dastan realizes that Nizam orchestrated the king's murder. Furthermore, Nizam has set up an ambush for Dastan along the Persian streets, but after a conflict with Garsiv, Dastan escapes. Nizam sends a group of covert warriors,
 the Hassansins, to kill Dastan and find the dagger.
During a sandstorm, Tamina tells Dastan that long ago,
 the gods unleashed a great sandstorm to destroy humanity but were moved by a young girl's offer to sacrifice
 herself in humanity's place and trapped the Sands of Time in a large sandglass. Tamina is the latest guardian of the dagger,
 given to the young girl by the gods, which can pierce the sandglass and potentially destroy the world but also enable the dagger's 
wielder to travel further back in time than the one minute's worth of sand the dagger holds.
 Dastan realizes that Nizam intends to travel back to his childhood, prevent himself from saving Sharaman from a lion attack,
 and grow up to become King of Persia in Sharaman's place. Amar captures the two again,
 but Dastan saves Amar's men from a Hassansin attack using the dagger.
 This convinces Amar to escort them to a sanctuary near the Hindu Kush, where
 Tamina will seal the dagger within the stone it first came from.
 At the sanctuary, they are found by Garsiv, whom Dastan convinces of his innocence,
 but the Hassansins ambush them, killing Garsiv and stealing the dagger.
Dastan's group travels back to Alamut to retrieve the dagger from Nizam and warn Tus of Nizam.
 Amar's right-hand man Seso dies retrieving the dagger for Dastan, who demonstrates the dagger's powers to Tus to convince him of the truth.
 Afterwards, Nizam interrupts them, kills Tus, and takes the dagger back.
 Tamina saves Dastan from being killed and the two head for the secret tunnels beneath the city that lead to the sandglass.
 When they reach Nizam, he stabs the sandglass and throws them both off a cliff.
 Tamina sacrifices herself, releasing Dastan's hand and falling to her death to allow him to fight Nizam.
Nizam thrusts the dagger into the esoterical column of sandglass under the temple.
 Dastan grabs hold of the hilt of the dagger together with Nizam; as sand is released from the sandglass, 
time rewinds to the moment Dastan found the dagger. He finds Tus and Garsiv and exposes Nizam's treachery.
 Nizam tries to kill Dastan, but Dastan easily defeats him yet spares him. Nizam gets up and attempts to
 attack again but is subdued and killed by Tus. Tus apologizes to Tamina for the siege and proposes to
 strengthen the two nations' bond by marital alliance of the Princess to Dastan. Dastan returns the dagger
 to Tamina as an engagement gift and tells her he looks forward to their future together.

In Medieval Scotland, Princess Merida of the clan Dunbroch is given a bow and arrow by her father,
 King Fergus for her sixth birthday to the dismay of her mother, Queen Elinor.
 While venturing into the woods to fetch an arrow, Merida encounters a will-o'-the-wisp.
 Soon afterward, Mor'du, a huge demon bear, attacks the family.
 Merida flees on horseback with Elinor, while Fergus and his men fend off Mor'du, though the fight costs him one of his legs.
Ten years later, Merida, now sixteen years old, discovers that she is to be betrothed to the son of one of her father's allies.
 Elinor explains that failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch, reminding Merida of a legend of a prince whose
 pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes destroyed his kingdom.
The allied clan chieftains and their first-born sons arrive to compete 
in the Highland games for Merida's hand in marriage. Merida twists the rules, announcing that as her own clan's firstborn
 she is eligible to compete for her own hand. She easily bests her suitors in an archery contest, shaming the other clans, and
 after a heated disagreement with Elinor, runs away into the forest. Wisps appear, leading her to the hut of an elderly witch.
 Merida bargains for a spell to change her fate, and the witch gives her an enchanted cake.
When Merida gives Elinor the cake, it transforms her into a bear, unable to speak but still retaining most of her human consciousness.
 Merida returns to the witch's cottage with Elinor, only to find it deserted, and discovers a message from the witch:
 unless Merida is able to "mend the bond torn by pride" before the second sunrise, the spell will become permanent.
 Merida and Elinor are led by the wisps to ancient ruins, where they encounter Mor'du.
 Realizing that Mor'du was the prince in the legend, Merida vows that she will not let the same thing happen to her mother,
 and concludes she needs to repair the family tapestry she damaged during their argument.
They return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war. Merida intends to relent and declare herself ready to choose a
 suitor as tradition demands, but Elinor prompts her instead to insist that the firstborns should be allowed to marry in their own
 time to whomever they choose. The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing and strengthening their alliance.
Merida sneaks into the tapestry room with Elinor, while Fergus, looking for his wife finds out she's gone.
 Elinor, who is losing her humanity, attacks Fergus, but suddenly regains her composure and flees the castle.
 Mistaking the queen for Mor'du and thinking it has eaten his wife, Fergus pursues the bear with the other clans,
 locking Merida in the castle. Merida escapes with the assistance of her identical triplet brothers, Harris, Hubert, and Hamish,
 who have also eaten the enchanted cake and are now bear cubs. Merida repairs the tapestry and rides out after her father.
 Fergus and the clans capture Elinor, but Merida thwarts them before the real Mor'du arrives.
 Mor'du batters the clan warriors and targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, holding off Mor'du and causing him to be crushed by a falling menhir.
 This releases the spirit of the prince, who silently thanks Merida for freeing him and transforms into a wisp.
 Merida covers her mother in the repaired tapestry, but she remains a bear.
 As the sun rises for the second time, Merida realizes the mistakes she has made and reconciles with Elinor, unknowingly fulfilling the
 true meaning of the witch's message and reversing the spell's effects on her mother and brothers.
With Mor'du gone, Merida and Elinor work together on a new tapestry when they are called to the docks to bid farewell to the other clans,
 and ride their horses together.

Whenever Litwak's Arcade closes, the various video game characters leave their in-game roles and socialize via a power strip.
 At a support group, Wreck-it Ralph, the villain of Fix-it Felix, Jr., expresses frustration with his assigned role, as he
 is mistreated by his game's NPCs while Felix is celebrated.
 When Ralph is excluded from the game's thirtieth-anniversary party, he determines to win a medal and earn some respect.
Overhearing that players in the first-person shooter Hero's Duty can earn medals, Ralph sneaks in and steals one while the game's
 characters are fighting Cy-Bugs, an insectoid enemy. Ralph accidentally launches himself in an escape shuttle with a Cy-Bug inside
 and crash-lands in the candy-themed kart racing game Sugar Rush. With Ralph gone, his game is labeled out of order.
 Felix leaves the game to find Ralph, allying with Sergeant Calhoun, the heroine of Hero's Duty, as she tracks the Cy-Bug,
 which may become a virus.
In Sugar Rush, Vanellope von Schweetz steals Ralph's medal and uses it to buy her way into the nightly race that determines which
 characters are playable the next day. King Candy forbids her to race, as she has a glitch that causes her to move and teleport erratically.
 Other racers destroy her kart until Ralph intervenes. Vanellope promises to get the medal back if Ralph helps her win;
 he reluctantly helps her build a new kart and teaches her to drive inside Diet Cola Mountain.
Calhoun and Felix arrive in Sugar Rush, and Felix explains that long ago,
 the titular hero of Turbo Time became jealous of the new racing game RoadBlasters, and tried to sabotage it, causing both games to be unplugged.
 Felix fears Ralph might be "going Turbo", too. Calhoun and Felix fall into Nesquik-sand, work together to escape, and begin to fall in love.
Meanwhile, King Candy hacks into Sugar Rush's source code and retrieves the medal,
 giving it back to Ralph. He warns that, if Vanellope becomes a playable character, her glitching might cause someone to
 unplug the game as 'broken'. Ralph decides he cannot allow Vanellope to race and destroys her kart. She breaks down in tears and runs away,
 labeling Ralph a true "bad guy". Calhoun abandons Felix when he inadvertently reminds her of her late fiance.
 Felix is captured at the palace by King Candy's assistant, Sour Bill, while Calhoun wanders the game alone, discovering the Cy-bug has
 multiplied exponentially.
Heartbroken and remorseful, Ralph returns to Fix-it Felix, Jr. and finds it abandoned.
 He angrily throws his medal, then notices that the Sugar Rush cabinet displays Vanellope as a playable character.
 Returning to Sugar Rush, Ralph interrogates Sour Bill, who admits that King Candy disconnected Vanellope's code and locked away
 the memories of the Sugar Rush characters so that no one knows her actual role. He explains that if Vanellope completes a race,
 all of King Candy's changes will be deleted and the game restored to normal.
Ralph frees Felix from King Candy's prison, fixes the kart, and reconciles with Vanellope,
 who enters the race. The Cy-Bugs emerge and start destroying the game; Calhoun, Felix, and Ralph help evacuate the characters.
 Unaware of this development, King Candy attempts to ram Vanellope off the track, causing her to glitch.
 She reveals King Candy to be Turbo, who took over Sugar Rush when his game was unplugged.
 Vanellope flees as Turbo is eaten by a Cy-Bug, which fuses with him into an insectoid monster.
Everyone but Vanellope evacuates, as glitches cannot leave their games. Remembering from Hero's Duty that
 a beacon will draw and destroy the Cy-Bugs, Ralph battles Turbo and collapses the Mentos roof of Diet Cola Mountain,
 creating an eruption which destroys Turbo and the Cy-Bugs. Vanellope rescues Ralph and crosses the finish line.
 The game resets, revealing her as the ruler of Sugar Rush, though she keeps her glitching ability, considering it an advantage.
Ralph returns to his game, content with his role as "villain" and respected by his fellow characters.
 Felix and Calhoun marry, and Ralph watches Vanellope become Sugar Rush's favorite character.

As a first grader, Mike Wazowski begins to dream of becoming a Scarer - a monster who enters the human world at night to scare
 children and harvest their screams for energy to power the city of Monstropolis. Eleven years later, Mike enrolls in the Scaring
 program at Monsters University (MU) and meets classmate James P. "Sulley" Sullivan.
 Abigail Hardscrabble, dean of MU, warns the students that anyone who does not pass a final exam at the end of the first semester
 will have to leave the Scaring program.
As the semester progresses, an intense rivalry forms between Mike, who studies hard to improve himself, and Sulley,
 who relies only on his natural talent and begins to falter. They both attempt to join a fraternity, but only Sulley is accepted into
 Roar Omega Roar (ROR), the most prestigious house on campus.
 At the final exam, a fight between the duo inadvertently destroys Hardscrabble’s prize scream canister.
 Hardscrabble tests them separately and fails them both -- Mike for not being scary, Sulley for choosing the wrong approach to scare a child
 without having all the relevant information about them. They are forced to transfer to a different study program, much to their dismay.
Wanting to prove himself, Mike learns of MU's "Scare Games" competition and makes a deal with Hardscrabble.
 If his team wins, all of the members will be admitted to the Scaring program, otherwise, he will leave MU.
 Mike joins Oozma Kappa (OK), a fraternity of misfits, but they are one member short of being able to enter the competition.
 Sulley offers to join OK, seeing it as his only chance to return to Scaring, and Mike reluctantly accepts.
OK finishes last in the first round but are saved from elimination after another team is disqualified for cheating.
 During each of the next three rounds, OK steadily improves due to Mike's knowledge of scaring and the others' unique talents.
 Despite their progress, they face humiliation by rival fraternities, and Hardscrabble questions whether Sulley believes that Mike can be
 an effective Scarer. Though OK earns a decisive victory over ROR in the final round,
 Mike discovers afterward that Sulley had tampered with the simulator settings to guarantee a win for OK, causing a heated argument
 between the two. The other OK members discard their trophy, equally ashamed that Sulley ruined their victory by cheating.
 Sulley confesses to Hardscrabble what he has done.
Outraged at Sulley's betrayal and still determined to prove that he can become a Scarer,
 Mike breaks into the school's door lab and enters the human world.
 He emerges in a summer camp cabin full of children but is unable to scare any of them and flees into the woods.
 With assistance from the OK members, Sulley sneaks through the door to find Mike,
 ignoring Hardscrabble's order to stay away from it and let the authorities handle the situation.
 Sulley finds Mike and tells him that the reason why he cheated was because he was afraid of failing his team and everyone on the campus
 all because Mike was not scary and admits that despite being a Sullivan, he's not as great of a success as his family.
 The two reconcile and try to return to MU, but find out that Hardscrabble has deactivated the door.
As police officers begin to chase Mike and Sulley, Mike realizes that they may be able to power the door from their side.
 Working together, the two scare the officers so badly that their screams overload the door, then return to MU just as it explodes.
 Mike and Sulley are punished and expelled from MU for their actions,
 but the remaining OK members are admitted into the Scaring program for the coming semester,
 impressing Hardscrabble for their performance in the Scare Games.
As Mike and Sulley are leaving the campus, Hardscrabble admits that they have surprised her and expresses her hope that they
 will continue to do so in the future. Seeing a "help wanted" advertisement for job openings at Monsters, Inc.,
 the two decide to apply and are hired to work in the mailroom.
 They work their way up to different jobs before being scarer and scare assistant respectively.
