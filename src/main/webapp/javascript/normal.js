A stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks (also called shares),
 which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange,
 as well as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private companies which are sold to investors through
 equity crowdfunding platforms. Investment is usually made with an investment strategy in mind.
Stocks can be categorized by the country where the company is domiciled.
 For example, Nestlé and Novartis are domiciled in Switzerland and traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange,
 so they may be considered as part of the Swiss stock market, although the stocks may also be traded on exchanges in other countries,
 for example, as American depositary receipts (ADRs) on U.S. stock markets.

Redmi is a subsidiary company owned by the Chinese electronics company Xiaomi.
It was first announced in July 2013 as a budget smartphone line, and became a separate sub-brand
 of Xiaomi in 2019 with entry-level and mid-range devices, while Xiaomi itself produces upper-range and flagship Xiaomi (formerly Mi) phones.
 Redmi phones use the Xiaomi's MIUI user interface on top of Android. 
Models are divided into the entry-level Redmi, the mid-range Redmi Note, and the high-end Redmi K.
In addition, the unrelated Mi A Android One series is also positioned in the similar market segment with Redmi devices,
 despite being part of the upper-range Xiaomi Mi lineup.
The most significant difference from other Xiaomi smartphones is that they use less-expensive components 
and thus have lower prices while retaining higher specifications. In August 2014, The Wall Street Journal
 reported that in the second quarter of the 2014 fiscal year, Xiaomi had a market share of 4% of smartphone
 shipment rankings in China. Redmi sales were attributed as a contributing factor toward this gain in shipment rankings.

 grenades, and other items featured can be found throughout the island.
 The ultimate goal of the players is to survive on the island with a maximum of 50 players online; this requires eliminating
 all opponents the players encounter along the way and ensuring that they are the only survivor remaining.
 The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing the surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters.

Anime is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan.
 In Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin.
 However, outside of Japan and in English, anime is colloquial for Japanese animation and refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.
 Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is referred to as anime-influenced animation.
The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917.
 A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience.
 Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet.
 In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games.
 It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.
Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies.
 It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques. 
Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots.
 Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.
The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios like Studio Ghibli, Sunrise, Bones, Ufotable, MAPPA, CoMix Wave Films and Toei Animation.
 Since the 1980s, the medium has also seen international success with the rise of foreign dubbed, subtitled programming and its increasing distribution through streaming services.
 As of 2016, Japanese anime accounted for 60% of the world's animated television shows.
In 2019, the annual overseas exports of Japanese animation exceeded $10 billion for the first time in history.

Pinocchio is a 1940 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and based on the 1883 Italian children's novel The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi.
 It was the second animated feature film produced by Disney, made after the first animated success Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).
The plot involves an old Italian woodcarver named Geppetto who carves a wooden puppet named Pinocchio.
 The puppet is brought to life by a blue fairy, who informs him that he can become a real boy if he proves 
himself to be "brave, truthful, and unselfish".
 Pinocchio's efforts to become a real boy involve encounters with a host of unsavory characters.
 The key character of Jiminy Cricket is based on a 100-year "wise, old" talking cricket from the original book,
 who warns Pinocchio of his impudence when they meet only to be killed in return shortly after, before returning as a ghost.
 The film was adapted by several storyboard artists from Collodi's book. The production was supervised by Ben Sharpsteen
 and Hamilton Luske, and the film's sequences were directed by Norman Ferguson, T. Hee, Wilfred Jackson, Jack Kinney, and Bill Roberts.
 Pinocchio was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, giving realistic movement to vehicles,
 machinery and natural elements such as rain, lightning, smoke, shadows and water.
 The film was released to theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on February 23, 1940.
Although it became the first animated feature to win a competitive Academy Award — winning two for Best Music,
 Original Score and for Best Music,
 Original Song for "When You Wish Upon a Star" — it was initially a box office bomb, mainly due to World War II
 cutting off the European and Asian markets overseas.
 It eventually made a profit in its 1945 reissue, and is considered one of the greatest animated films ever made,
 with a 100% rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes. The film and characters are still prevalent in popular culture,
 featuring at various Disney parks and in other forms of entertainment.
 In 1994, Pinocchio was added to the United States National Film Registry for being deemed "culturally, historically,
 or aesthetically significant".

 King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi present their newborn son, Simba, to the gathering animals by Rafiki the mandrill, the kingdom's shaman and advisor.
Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the "circle of life," which connects all living things.
 Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne and plots to get rid of Mufasa and Simba so that he may become king.
 He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala into exploring a forbidden elephants' graveyard, where they are chased by three hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed.
 Mufasa is alerted by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs.
 Though upset with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba.
 Meanwhile, Scar visits the hyenas and convinces them to help him overthrow Mufasa in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands.
Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede that will trample him.
 He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing that the king will rush to save his son.

 Scar then convinces Simba that the tragedy was the latter's own fault and advises him to leave the kingdom and never return.
 He also orders the hyenas to kill Simba, but he escapes.
 Scar tells the pride that the stampede killed Mufasa and Simba and steps forward as the new king, allowing the hyenas' clan to live in the Pride Lands.
Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog, rescue Simba, who has collapsed in a desert.
 Simba grows up with his two new friends in their oasis, living a carefree life under the motto "hakuna matata".

 Enraged, Simba forces him to tell the truth to the rest of the pride.
 Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at a ledge near the top of Pride Rock.
 Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame his crimes on the hyenas;
 Simba spares his life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever, but throws him off after Scar attacks him again.
 The hyenas, who have overheard Scar's intention of betraying them, angrily maul him to death.
 Simba reclaims leadership and Nala becomes his queen.

A group of living toys, who assume lifelessness around humans, are preparing to move into a new house with their 
owner Andy Davis, his sister Molly and their single mother.
 The toys become uneasy when Andy has his birthday party a week early; to calm them, Sheriff Woody,
 Andy's favorite toy and their leader, sends Sarge and his green army men to spy on the gift opening with a baby monitor.
 The other toys (which include Mr.
 Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Rex the tyrannosaur, Hamm the piggy bank, and Bo Peep the porcelain doll)
 are relieved when Andy receives nothing that could replace them.
 Andy then receives a last-minute surprise gift – a Buzz Lightyear action figure who believes he is a real space ranger.
 Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features and becomes Andy's new favorite, making Woody jealous.
Two days before the move, Andy's family plans for a dinner at Pizza Planet, where Andy is allowed to bring along only one toy.
 To ensure Andy chooses him and not Buzz, Woody tries to use the radio-controlled car RC to knock Buzz behind the desk,
 but accidentally knocks him out a window instead. The other toys 
believe Woody deliberately tried to kill Buzz, but Andy arrives and takes Woody before they can exact revenge.
 A vengeful Buzz stows away in the car, and confronts Woody when the car stops at a gas station on the way to Pizza Planet.
 The two fight, fall out of the car, and are left behind.
After a further argument, the two hitch a ride on a Pizza Planet delivery truck and sneak into the restaurant.
 Buzz mistakenly believes a claw crane full of Little Green Men to be a true rocket, and Woody climbs in after him.
 Andy's sadistic next-door neighbor Sid spots and captures the two and takes them to his house, where they encounter
 his Bull Terrier Scud and his much-abused "mutant" toys made from parts of other toys he has destroyed.
As Woody tries to find an escape route, Buzz is shocked by a TV commercial that reveals he is indeed a toy.
 In denial, he attempts to fly, but breaks his arm off and falls into despair.
 After Sid's toys fix Buzz, Sid returns and tapes Buzz to a rocket, but a thunderstorm forces him to delay the launch until the next morning.
 Overnight, Woody helps Buzz realize that his purpose is making Andy happy, restoring Buzz's resolve.
 Sid takes Buzz out to launch him, but Woody rallies the mutant toys to frighten Sid into never harming toys again, freeing Buzz.
Woody and Buzz pursue Andy's moving truck, but Scud sees them and gives chase, biting Woody.
 Buzz fights off Scud, while Woody, freed, climbs into the truck and pushes RC out, using him to distract Scud and rescue Buzz.
 The other toys, thinking Woody is now trying to get rid of RC, toss Woody back into the street.
 Having escaped Scud, Buzz and Woody pursue the truck on RC, and the other toys spot them coming and realize their error.
 During the chase, RC's batteries run out, forcing Woody to ignite the rocket still strapped to Buzz.
 As they launch towards the truck, they become airborne, and Woody drops RC into the truck.
 Buzz opens his wings to sever the tape just before the rocket explodes;
 he and Woody glide over the truck and fall through the sunroof of Andy's car, landing safely beside Andy.
At Christmas, in the new house, Sarge and his men spy on the gift opening again while the other toys wait.
 Mr. Potato Head is delighted when Molly gets a Mrs. Potato Head, and Woody and Buzz jokingly ponder what gift could 
be "worse" than Buzz, only to nervously smile at each other when Andy gets a dachshund puppy.

In the late 1880s, a British couple and their infant son are shipwrecked off the Congolese coast.
 The adults build a treehouse but are killed by Sabor, a leopard.
 Kala, a female gorilla who recently lost her own child to Sabor, finds the human infant and takes him back to the jungle to raise as her own, naming him Tarzan.
 Kerchak, her mate and the gorilla troop's leader, strongly disapproves.
Years later, Tarzan begins to befriend other animals, including a young female gorilla named Terk and the paranoid male elephant, Tantor.
 Tarzan finds himself treated differently because of his different physique, so he makes great efforts to improve himself.
 As an adult, when Sabor attacks the gorillas again, Tarzan manages to kill Sabor with his crafted crude spear, gaining Kerchak's reluctant respect.
The gorilla troop's peaceful life is interrupted by the arrival of a team of human explorers from England, consisting of Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, his daughter, Jane, and their hunter escort Clayton, who are looking to study gorillas.
 Jane accidentally becomes separated from the group and is chased by a mandrill troop, until Tarzan saves her out of sheer curiosity.
 He realizes that she is human, just like he is.
 Jane leads Tarzan back to their camp, where Porter and Clayton both take great interest in him; the former in terms of scientific progress, while the latter hopes to have Tarzan lead the group to the gorillas.
 Despite Kerchak's warnings to avoid the strangers, Tarzan repeatedly returns to the camp.
 Porter, Clayton, and Jane teach him to speak English properly, and tell him what the human world is like.
 Tarzan and Jane begin to fall in love;
 however, she has difficulty convincing Tarzan to lead the humans to the gorillas, as Tarzan fears Kerchak would hurt them.
The explorers' ship soon returns to retrieve them. Jane asks Tarzan to return with them to England, but Tarzan, in turn, asks Jane to stay with him when Jane says it is unlikely they will ever return.
 Clayton convinces Tarzan that Jane will stay with him forever as long as he leads them to the gorillas; Tarzan agrees, and leads the trio to the nesting grounds while Terk and Tantor lure Kerchak.
 Porter and Jane are excited to mingle with the gorillas, but Kerchak returns and attacks the humans on sight.
 Tarzan restrains Kerchak while the humans escape; afterwards, Kerchak coldly accuses Tarzan of disobeying him and betraying his family, causing Tarzan to flee in shame.
 Kala takes Tarzan to the treehouse where she found him, reveals his true past, and says that she wants him to be happy whatever he decides.
 Tarzan puts on his late father's suit, signifying his decision to go to England.
When Tarzan boards the ship with Jane and Porter the next day, they are ambushed by Clayton and his traitorous band of stowaway thugs.
 Clayton reveals his plans to capture and sell the gorillas for a fortune now that he knows where the nesting grounds are, and imprisons Tarzan, Jane, and Porter to prevent them from interfering.
 Tarzan manages to escape with the help of Terk and Tantor, and he returns to the jungle, rallying the animals to come to the aid of the gorillas and scare off the thugs. Clayton fatally shoots Kerchak and battles Tarzan across the treetops.
 Tarzan destroys Clayton’s rifle, causing him to attack Tarzan with his machete until Tarzan traps Clayton within a cluster of vines.
 As Clayton struggles to cut himself free, one of the vines gets wrapped around his neck; he eventually falls from the treetops, hanging himself to death.
 Kerchak, with his dying breath, finally accepts Tarzan as his son, and names him the leader of the gorilla troop.
The next day, Porter and Jane prepare to leave on the ship while Tarzan stays behind with the gorillas.
 As the ship leaves shore, Porter encourages his daughter to stay with the man she loves, and Jane jumps overboard to return to shore; Porter shortly follows her.
 The Porters reunite with Tarzan and his family, and embark on their new life together.

A long time ago, a drop of magical sunlight falls from the sky and sprouts a flower with healing powers.
 Upon discovering it, an old beggar woman named Mother Gothel hides the flower and uses it to stay young
 for centuries, until royal soldiers from a nearby kingdom find and uproot it to save their pregnant and
 ill Queen. A few days later, the Queen gives birth to a baby princess with long golden hair. While the 
king and queen are sleeping one evening, Gothel discovers the hair has the same powers as the flower, but
 turns brown and becomes powerless when cut.
 She kidnaps the girl, names her Rapunzel, and raises her in a hidden tower in the woods, using her hair to stay young
Each year, on Rapunzel's birthday, the king and queen release thousands of sky lanterns in hopes she will see them and return home.
 Rapunzel becomes obsessed with the distant lights, and, on the eve of her 18th birthday, asks Gothel for permission to see them closer.
 Gothel claims that the outside world is too dangerous and Rapunzel is too weak and young to survive in it. Later, handsome thief
 Flynn Rider steals Rapunzel's intended crown from the palace, abandons his partners, the Stabbington Brothers, and takes refuge in the tower.
 Rapunzel knocks him out and hides him in a closet. She considers showing him to Gothel as proof she is capable of taking
 care of herself; however, Gothel refuses to let her broach the subject, so Rapunzel sends Gothel on a three-day journey to get new paints.
Rapunzel hides the crown, not realizing it is her own, and tells Flynn he can only get it back by taking her to see the lights.
 Along the way, they stop at the Snuggly Duckling pub, where menacing thugs try to capture the wanted Flynn.
 Rapunzel soon charms them into revealing their softer sides; when royal guards arrive, the thugs help her and Flynn to escape.
 Meanwhile, Gothel becomes suspicious, returns to the empty tower, and finds the crown.
 She sets out to find Rapunzel, and allies herself with the Stabbington brothers.
In escaping from the guards, Flynn and Rapunzel become trapped in a fast-flooding cave.
 Thinking they will die, Flynn resignedly reveals his true name (Eugene Fitzherbert) and Rapunzel reveals her magic powers.
 Her glowing hair shows a previously hidden exit, and they escape and take refuge in the woods.
 That night, Gothel catches up to Rapunzel while Eugene is away, gives her the crown, and tells her to use it to test Eugene's loyalty.
The next morning, a palace horse named Maximus tracks down Eugene and attempts to arrest him. Rapunzel demands a truce in honor of her birthday,
 and Maximus reluctantly agrees, joining them as they go to the kingdom and take part in a festival in honor of the "lost princess".
 They spend the day celebrating with the townsfolk, then sail onto the lake to watch the solemn release of the lanterns firsthand.
 Having fulfilled her dream, Rapunzel gives Eugene back the crown. The two confess their love, and are about to kiss,
 when Eugene sees the Stabbington brothers. He walks off to apologize, and offers them the crown, but they tie him to a ship so the
 royal guards will arrest him and Rapunzel will think he abandoned her.
 They then try to capture Rapunzel, but Gothel stages a "rescue" and takes Rapunzel home.
Eugene escapes with the help of Maximus and the pub thugs.
 Meanwhile, Rapunzel realizes she has subconsciously incorporated the kingdom's standard into her artwork all her life;
 finally understanding that she is the "lost princess", she confronts Gothel.
 Eugene arrives at the tower, climbing up Rapunzel's hair, but then discovers her bound and gagged.
 Gothel fatally stabs him, and tries to drag Rapunzel to a new hiding place.
 Rapunzel offers to stop struggling and go willingly, if Gothel will allow her to heal Eugene.
 Realizing this means Rapunzel will grow old and die in Gothel's clutches, Eugene cuts off Rapunzel's hair before she can heal him.
 Gothel begins to age rapidly and turns to dust as she falls out of the tower.
Rapunzel mourns the death of Eugene, and one of her tears saves his life, still having some of the sun's power in it.
 Eugene reunites Rapunzel with her real parents, is fully pardoned for his crimes, and he and Rapunzel are married as the kingdom celebrates.

 a horrified Elsa confesses she does not know how to undo her magic. Her fear causes her powers to manifest themselves once more,
 and she accidentally freezes Anna's heart, seriously injuring her. In desperation to keep Anna safe,
 Elsa creates a giant snow monster named Marshmallow, who chases Anna and Kristoff away.
 Realizing the effects of Elsa's spell on Anna, Kristoff takes her to the trolls, his adoptive family.
 Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless "an act of true love" reverses the spell.
Kristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss. Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace; defeating Marshmallow
 (who falls into a chasm) and capturing Elsa. Anna is delivered to Hans, but rather than kissing her, Hans instead reveals that he has
 actually been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters.
 Hans locks a heartbroken Anna in a room to die and then manipulates the dignitaries into believing that Elsa killed her,
 but not before they were married. He orders the queen's execution, only to discover she has escaped her detention cell.
 Anna is freed by Olaf, her childhood talking snowman companion, and they venture into the blizzard outside to meet Kristoff,
 who Olaf has revealed is in love with her. Hans confronts Elsa outside, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa 
to break down and abruptly stop the storm. Anna spots Hans about to kill Elsa; she leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans.
 Devastated, Elsa hugs and mourns over her sister, who thaws out, her heroism constituting "an act of true love".
Realizing that love is the key to controlling her magic, Elsa ends the winter.
 Hans is arrested and exiled from the kingdom for his treason and attempted assassination,
 while the Duke's trade links with Arendelle are cut off. Anna gives Kristoff a new sleigh and the two kiss.
 The sisters are reunited, and Elsa promises never to lock the castle gates again.
In a post-credits scene, Marshmallow, having survived the fall, finds Elsa's discarded crown and places it on top of its head.

Within the mind of a young girl named Riley are the basic emotions that control her actions:
 Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. Her experiences become memories, stored as colored orbs,
 which are sent into long-term memory each night. The aspects of five most important "core memories"
 within her personality incorporate the form of floating islands.
 Joy acts as the leader, and she and the rest of the emotions try to limit Sadness's influence.
At the age of 11, Riley moves from Minnesota to San Francisco for her father's new job.
 She at first has poor experiences; the new house is cramped and old, her father hardly has any time for her,
 a local pizza parlor only serves pizza topped with broccoli (which Riley dislikes),
 and the moving van with their belongings ends up in Texas and will not arrive for weeks.
 On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness retroactively turns joyous memories sad,
 which causes Riley to cry in front of her class and creates a sad core memory.
 Joy tries to dispose of it by using a vacuum tube but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness,
 disabling the personality islands.
 Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters.
In Joy and Sadness's absence, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are forced to take control of Riley with disastrous results,
 distancing Riley from her parents, friends, and hobbies. Because of this, her personality islands gradually crumble
 and fall into the "Memory Dump", where memories are forgotten.
 Finally, Anger resolves to return to Minnesota, believing it will restore her happiness.
While navigating the vast long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong,
 Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the "train of thought" back to Headquarters.
 The three, after extreme inconvenience caused by the islands' dissolution, eventually catch the train but it halts when Riley falls asleep,
 then derails entirely with the collapse of another island. Desperate, Joy abandons Sadness and tries to ride a "recall tube"
 back to the Headquarters but the ground below the tube collapses, breaking and sending Joy and Bing Bong plunging into the Memory Dump.
 After discovering a sad memory that turned happy in Riley's parents' comfort to her,
 Joy understands Sadness's purpose: alerting others when Riley is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help.
 Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong's old wagon rocket, which gets energy when the rider sings, to escape the Memory Dump,
 but are unable to fly high enough due to their combined weight.
 On their last attempt, Bing Bong jumps out to allow Joy to escape as he fades away.
Joy reunites with Sadness and they return to Headquarters, but arrive too late as Anger's idea has disabled the console,
 rendering Riley apathetic as she boards a bus to Minnesota. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness,
 who is able to reactivate it and prompt Riley to return to her new home. As Sadness reinstalls the core memories,
 transforming them from happy to sad, Riley tearfully confesses to her parents that she misses her old life and breaks down in tears.
 Her parents comfort her and admit they also miss Minnesota. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory consisting
 of happiness and sadness;
 a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco.
A year later, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and returned to her old hobbies while acquiring a few new ones.
 Inside Headquarters, her emotions admire Riley's new personality islands, and all work together on a newly expanded console with
 room for them all.

Mowgli, a young orphan boy, is found in a basket in the deep jungles of India by Bagheera, a black panther who promptly takes him to Raksha,
 a mother wolf who has just had cubs. She and her mate, Rama, raise him along with their own cubs and after ten years, Mowgli becomes well
 acquainted with jungle life and plays with his wolf siblings.
 Bagheera is pleased with how happy Mowgli is now, but also worries that Mowgli must eventually return to his own kind.
One night, the wolf pack parents meet at Council Rock, having learned that Shere Khan, a man-eating Bengal tiger, has returned to the
 pack's part of the jungle. Pack leader Akela decides that Mowgli must leave the jungle for his own safety.
 Bagheera volunteers to escort him to a "Man-Village". They leave that very night, but Mowgli is determined to stay in the jungle.
 He and Bagheera rest in a tree for the night, where Kaa, a hungry Indian python, tries to devour Mowgli, but Bagheera intervenes.
 The next morning, Mowgli tries to join the elephant patrol, led by Colonel Hathi and his wife Winifred. Bagheera finds Mowgli, but after a
 fight, decides to leave Mowgli on his own. Mowgli soon meets up with the laid-back, fun-loving sloth bear Baloo, who promises to raise Mowgli
 himself and never take him to the Man-Village.
Shortly afterward, a group of monkeys kidnap Mowgli and take him to their leader, King Louie the orangutan.
 King Louie offers to help Mowgli stay in the jungle if he will tell Louie how to make fire, like other humans.
 However, since he was not raised by humans, Mowgli does not know how to make fire.
 Bagheera and Baloo arrive to rescue Mowgli and in the ensuing chaos, King Louie's palace is demolished to rubble.
 Bagheera speaks to Baloo that night and convinces him that the jungle will never be safe for Mowgli with Shere Khan around.
 In the morning, Baloo reluctantly explains to Mowgli that the Man-Village is best for him, but Mowgli accuses him of breaking his
 promise and runs away. As Baloo sets off in search of Mowgli, Bagheera rallies the help of Hathi and his patrol.
 However, Shere Khan himself, who was eavesdropping on Bagheera and Hathi's conversation, is now determined to hunt and kill Mowgli himself.
Meanwhile, Mowgli encounters Kaa once again, who again attempts to eat him after hypnotizing him to sleep,
 but he wakes up and escapes thanks to the unwitting intervention of the suspicious Shere Khan. As a storm gathers,
 a depressed Mowgli encounters a group of friendly vultures who accept Mowgli as a fellow outcast. Shere Khan appears shortly after,
 scaring off the vultures and confronting Mowgli. Baloo rushes to the rescue and tries to keep Shere Khan away from Mowgli, but is nearly killed.
 When lightning strikes a nearby tree and sets it ablaze, the vultures swoop in to distract Shere Khan, while Mowgli grabs a
 large flaming branch and ties it to the tiger's tail.
 Shere Khan, who is terrified of fire, panics and runs away.
Bagheera and Baloo take Mowgli to the edge of the Man-Village,
 but Mowgli is still hesitant to go there. However, his mind abruptly changes when he is smitten by a beautiful young girl
 named Shanti from the village who is coming down by the riverside to fetch water. After noticing Mowgli, she "accidentally" drops her water pot.
 Mowgli retrieves it for her and follows her into the Man-Village.
 After Mowgli shrugs to Baloo and Bagheera, to show that he has made up his mind and chosen to go to the Man-Village,
 Baloo and Bagheera decide to head home, content that Mowgli is safe and happy with his own kind.

On the Polynesian island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess of nature Te Fiti,
 who brought life to the ocean long ago using a pounamu stone as her heart and the source of her power.
 Maui, the shape-shifting demigod of the wind and sea and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation.
 However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked offshore by Te Kā, a volcanic demon.
 He loses both his magical giant fishhook and the heart to the depths of the sea.
A thousand years later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui,
 to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui and Sina, Moana's mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her to become the island's chief.
 Sixteen years later, a blight strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch.
 Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and find out what is happening, but Tui forbids it.
 Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui.
That afternoon, Moana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole
 Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te Kā's darkness is poisoning the island,
 but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and has him restore the heart of Te Fiti. Having been given the heart of Te Fiti by the ocean,
 Tala gives it to Moana. Tala later falls ill and, on her deathbed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.
Setting sail on a camakau from the cavern along with the hen named Heihei, Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island
 where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave.
 She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora—coconut pirates—who seek the heart,
 but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces
 him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical fishhook in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa,
 a giant coconut crab. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook, only to find himself unable to control his shape-shifting.
 He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook.
 Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents abandoned him as an infant, and the gods, 
taking pity on him, granted him his powers.
 After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.
They arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te Kā. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged.
 Unwilling to lose his hook in another confrontation with Te Kā, Maui abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else
 to restore the heart and loses hope. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling.
 She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te Kā. Maui returns,
 having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te Kā, destroying his hook in the process.
 Upon being unable to find Te Fiti, Moana realizes Te Kā is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart.
 The ocean clears a path for Moana, allowing her to return the heart to Te Fiti, who heals the ocean and islands of the blight.
 Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who fixes his hook and decorates Moana's boat with flowers before falling into a deep sleep and becoming an island.
Moana bids farewell to Maui and Te Fiti, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and wayfinder,
 leading her people as they resume voyaging with Maui flying over them in Hawk form.
In a post-credits scene, Tamatoa, still stuck on his back, addresses the audience, knowing they would help if he was named Sebastian.

An enchantress disguised as an old beggar woman arrives at a castle during a ball and offers the host,
 a cruel and selfish prince, an enchanted rose in return for shelter from a storm. When he refuses the offer,
 the enchantress reveals her true form and transforms the prince into a beast and his servants into household
 objects before erasing the castle, himself, and his servants from the memories of their loved ones and everyone
 else in the town. She warns the prince that the curse will be broken, only if he can learn to love another and have
 that person love him in return by the time the last petal of the rose falls, or else he will remain a beast for the
 rest of his life while his servants become inanimate.
Several years later, in the small town of Villeneuve, Belle, the book-loving daughter of a widowed artist named Maurice,
 dreams of adventure. She constantly brushes off advances from Gaston, an arrogant war veteran as he is not the type of
 man Belle wishes to marry. On Maurice's way to the market, he becomes lost in the forest and after narrowly escaping a
 pack of wolves he seeks refuge in the Beast's castle. However, the Beast imprisons him when he "stole" a rose from his
 garden as a gift to Belle. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search of him, and finds him
 locked in the castle dungeon. Belle asks the Beast to let her take his place; the Beast agrees and drags Maurice away.
Belle befriends the castle's servants, including candelabra/footman Lumiere, mantel clock/majordomo Cogsworth,
 feather-duster/maid Plumette, teapot/housekeeper Mrs. Potts, and her son, Chip, who is now a teacup.
 They invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast
 scares her into the woods. Belle is ambushed off-guard by the wolves from earlier, but the Beast rescues her, injuring
 himself in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a spark develops between them. The Beast shows Belle a gift from the
 enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they want. Belle uses the book to visit her childhood home in Paris,
 where she discovers a plague doctor's mask and realizes that she and her father were forced to leave when her mother succumbed
 to the Bubonic plague, the one thing her father couldn't tell her all those years.
In Villeneuve, Maurice fails to convince the other villagers of the Beast and Belle's imprisonment.
 Gaston, seeing rescuing Belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage, agrees to help Maurice.
 When Maurice learns of his ulterior motive and rejects him, Gaston abandons him to be eaten by the wolves.
 Maurice is rescued by the town hermit Agathe, but when he tells the townsfolk of Gaston's crime and is unable to provide solid evidence,
 Gaston convinces them to send Maurice to an insane asylum.
After sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father's predicament using a magic mirror.
 The Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. Arriving back to the town,
 Belle reveals the Beast in the mirror much to the shock of the townsfolk, proving her father's sanity.
 Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, a jealous Gaston claims she has been charmed by dark magic and has her thrown into
 the asylum carriage with her father. He rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast before he
 "curses" the whole village. Inside the asylum carriage, Belle tells her father that she already knows what happened to
 her mother and showed him the rose rattle she took from her magical visit to their old, abandoned home.
 Maurice and Belle escape, and Belle rushes back to the castle.
During the battle, Gaston abandons his companion LeFou, who then sides with the servants to fend off the villagers.
 Meanwhile, he attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return.
 He overwhelms Gaston, but spares his life at the last second before reuniting with Belle.
 However, Gaston treacherously shoots the Beast from a bridge, which then collapses as the castle begins to crumble, leading Gaston
 to fall to his death. The Beast then dies just as the last petal falls and the servants become inanimate objects themselves shortly
 after the ordeal.
As Belle tearfully professes her love to the Beast, Agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the
 curse which repairs the crumbling castle, revives the Beast and restores him and his servants to their human
 forms and to the villagers' memories once again. The movie ends with the Prince and Belle hosting a ball for the kingdom,
 where they dance happily.

In Santa Cecilia, Mexico, Miguel dreams of becoming a musician, even though his family strictly forbids it.
 His great-great-grandmother Imelda was married to a man who left her and their daughter Coco to pursue a career in music,
 and when he never returned, Imelda banished music from her family's life before starting a shoemaking business.
Miguel now lives with the elderly Coco and their family, including Miguel's parents and his abuelita, who are all shoemakers.
 He secretly idolizes Ernesto de la Cruz, a famous musician who died decades earlier, and teaches himself to play guitar from
 Ernesto's old films. On the Day of the Dead, Miguel accidentally damages the picture frame that holds a photo of Coco with
 her mother on the family ofrenda, discovering that a hidden section of the photograph shows his great-great-grandfather
 holding Ernesto's famous guitar. Concluding that Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather, an inspired Miguel leaves to enter
 a talent show for Day of the Dead despite his family's objections.
Breaking into Ernesto's mausoleum, Miguel takes his guitar to use in the show, but once he strums it,
 he becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza. However, he can interact with his skeletal dead relatives
, who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him back with them, they learn that Imelda cannot visit,
 since Miguel accidentally removed her photo from the ofrenda. Miguel discovers that he is cursed for stealing from the dead,
 and must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise, or he will become one of the dead; to do so, he must receive a blessing
 from a member of his family. Imelda offers Miguel a blessing on the condition he end his dream of becoming a musician, but Miguel
 refuses and resolves to seek Ernesto's blessing instead. He meets Héctor, who declares that he knows Ernesto, offering to help him
 reach him in return for Miguel taking his photo back with him, so that he might visit his daughter before she forgets him, causing
 him to disappear completely. Héctor helps Miguel enter a talent competition to win entry to Ernesto's mansion, but Miguel's family
 tracks him down, forcing him to flee.
Miguel sneaks into the mansion, where Ernesto welcomes him as his descendant,
 but Héctor confronts them, again imploring Miguel to take his photo to the Land of the Living.
 Ernesto and Héctor renew an argument from their partnership in life, and Miguel realizes that when Héctor decided to
 leave the duo to return to his family, Ernesto poisoned him, then stole his guitar along with his songs, passing them off as
 his own to become famous. To protect his legacy, Ernesto seizes the photo and has his security guards throw Miguel and Héctor into a cenote pit.
 There, Miguel realizes that Héctor is his real great-great-grandfather, and that Coco is Héctor's daughter.
After Imelda and the family rescue the duo, Miguel reveals the truth about Héctor's death.
 Imelda and Héctor reconcile, and the family infiltrates Ernesto's concert to retrieve Héctor's photo.
 Ernesto's crimes are exposed to the audience, who jeer at him as he is thrown out of the stadium, then crushed by a giant
 bell in the same manner that he originally died. In the chaos, however, Héctor's photograph is lost. 
As the sun rises, Coco's life and memory are fading; Imelda and Héctor bless Miguel, so that he can return to the Land of the Living.
 After Miguel plays "Remember Me", Coco brightens and sings along with Miguel.
 She reveals that she had saved the torn-off piece of the family photo with Héctor's face on it,
 then tells her family stories about her father, thus saving his memory as well as his existence in the Land of the Dead.
 Miguel's family reconciles with him, ending the ban on music.
One year later, Miguel presents the family ofrenda (which now includes the deceased Coco)
 to his new baby sister Socorro.[15]: 128  Coco's collected letters from Héctor prove that Ernesto stole his songs,
 destroying Ernesto's ill-gotten legacy and allowing Héctor to be rightfully honored in his place. In the Land of the Dead,
 Héctor and Imelda rekindle their romance, joining Coco and the rest of their family for a visit to the living, where Miguel
 in a mariachi costume sings and plays for his relatives, both living and dead.
