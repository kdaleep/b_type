                            Touch typing improves typing speed and accuracy. A touch typist never looks at the keyboard.
                            The fingers hit the right keys by force of habit. The typist is entirely focused on the text being typed,
                            reading the words and phrases as the fingers type the text reflexively
                            . Touch typing can be learned by performing special exercises.
                            Stage one of the process begins with learning the home row of the keyboard (the row beginning with the Caps Lock key).
                            Looking at the keyboard is strictly forbidden. 
                            This is followed by learning the lower and upper rows, the numbers row, upper-case letters and special symbols.
                            Stage two involves memorizing frequently used syllables and typing words containing these syllables.
                            Stage three involves typing actual text to perfect the skills acquired.

                             Curve your fingers a little and put them on the ASDF and JKL; keys which are located in the middle row of the letter keys.
                            This row is called HOME ROW because you always start from these keys and always return to them.
                            F and J keys under your index fingers should have a raised line on them to aide in finding these keys without looking.

                                       <li> Always return to the starting position of the fingers "ASDF â€“ JKL;".
                                       <li> When typing, imagine the location of the symbol on the keyboard.
                                       <li> Establish and maintain a rhythm while typing. Your keystrokes should come at equal intervals.
                                       <li> The SHIFT key is always pressed by the pinky finger opposite to the one hitting the other key.
                                       <li>  Use the thumb of whichever hand is more convenient for you to press the Space bar.

                                This method may seem inconvenient at first, but do not stop, eventually, you'll find out that you are typing quickly,
                             easily, and conveniently. To achieve the maximum result, choose a touch typing course for your keyboard layout and in the desired language.

                                       <li> Take your time when typing to avoid mistakes. The speed will pick up as you progress.

                                       <li> Limit your hand and finger movement only to what is necessary to press a specific key.
                                       <li> Keep your  hands and fingers close to the base position. This improves typing speed and reduces stress on the hands.
                                       <li> Don't look at the keys when you type. Just slide your fingers around until they find the home row marking.
                                       <li> Don't hammer on the keys. Try using the minimum force possible.
                                       <li> To switch between upper/lower case always use the opposite hand.

                                       <li> The chair and table height should be chosen so as to expose the shoulder, arm, and wrist muscles to the least possible strain.
                                       <li> The wrists can touch the tabletop in front of the keyboard. Never shift even a portion of your body weight to the wrists by resting on them.
