A stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks (also called shares),
 which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange,
 as well as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private companies which are sold to investors through
 equity crowdfunding platforms. Investment is usually made with an investment strategy in mind.

Redmi is a subsidiary company owned by the Chinese electronics company Xiaomi.
It was first announced in July 2013 as a budget smartphone line, and became a separate sub-brand
 of Xiaomi in 2019 with entry-level and mid-range devices, while Xiaomi itself produces upper-range and flagship Xiaomi (formerly Mi) phones.
 Redmi phones use the Xiaomi's MIUI user interface on top of Android. 
Models are divided into the entry-level Redmi, the mid-range Redmi Note, and the high-end Redmi K.
In addition, the unrelated Mi A Android One series is also positioned in the similar market segment with Redmi devices,
 despite being part of the upper-range Xiaomi Mi lineup.
The most significant difference from other Xiaomi smartphones is that they use less-expensive components 
and thus have lower prices while retaining higher specifications. In August 2014, The Wall Street Journal
 reported that in the second quarter of the 2014 fiscal year, Xiaomi had a market share of 4% of smartphone
 shipment rankings in China. Redmi sales were attributed as a contributing factor toward this gain in shipment rankings.

Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company that specializes in consumer electronics, software and online services.
 Apple is the largest information technology company by revenue (totaling US$365.8 billion in 2021) and, as of January 2021
, it is the world's most valuable company, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer.
 It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.
Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's
 Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer,
 Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the Apple II became a best seller. Apple went public in 1980,
 to instant financial success. The company went onto develop new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces,
 including the original Macintosh, announced in a critically acclaimed advertisement, "1984", directed by Ridley Scott.
 By 1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably,
 while Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.
As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s,
 Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones
 (also known as "Wintel"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating
 system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through
 a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching memorable advertising
 campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio.
 Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later. He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.
Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then $2 trillion in August 2020,
 and most recently $3 trillion in January 2022. The company sometimes receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors,
 its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless,
 the company enjoys a high level of brand loyalty, and is ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.

Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology corporation which produces computer software, consumer electronics,
 personal computers, and related services. Its best-known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems,
 the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game
 consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft ranked No. 21 in the 2020 Fortune 500 rankings
 of the largest United States corporations by total revenue; it was the world's largest software maker by revenue as of 2016.
 It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Google, Amazon, Apple, and Meta.
Microsoft (the word being a portmanteau of "microcomputer software") was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4,
 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system
 market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), 
and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees.
 Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions,
 their largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016, followed by their acquisition of Skype
 Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.
As of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite market,
 although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android.
 The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including
 Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure),
 and software development (Visual Studio).
Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000, and later envisioned a "devices and services" strategy.
 This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008, entering the personal computer production market for the first time in June
 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile
 through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014,
 the company has scaled back on hardware and has instead focused on cloud computing, a move that helped the company's
 shares reach its highest value since December 1999.
Earlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018 Microsoft reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly
 traded company in the world. In April 2019, Microsoft reached the trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third U.S.
 public company to be valued at over $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon respectively. As of 2020, Microsoft has the third-highest
 global brand valuation.

Pinocchio is a 1940 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and based on the 1883 Italian children's novel The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi.
 It was the second animated feature film produced by Disney, made after the first animated success Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).
The plot involves an old Italian woodcarver named Geppetto who carves a wooden puppet named Pinocchio.
 The puppet is brought to life by a blue fairy, who informs him that he can become a real boy if he proves 
himself to be "brave, truthful, and unselfish".
 Pinocchio's efforts to become a real boy involve encounters with a host of unsavory characters.
 The key character of Jiminy Cricket is based on a 100-year "wise, old" talking cricket from the original book,
 who warns Pinocchio of his impudence when they meet only to be killed in return shortly after, before returning as a ghost.
 The film was adapted by several storyboard artists from Collodi's book. The production was supervised by Ben Sharpsteen
 and Hamilton Luske, and the film's sequences were directed by Norman Ferguson, T. Hee, Wilfred Jackson, Jack Kinney, and Bill Roberts.
 Pinocchio was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, giving realistic movement to vehicles,
 machinery and natural elements such as rain, lightning, smoke, shadows and water.
 The film was released to theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on February 23, 1940.
Although it became the first animated feature to win a competitive Academy Award — winning two for Best Music,
 Original Score and for Best Music,
 Original Song for "When You Wish Upon a Star" — it was initially a box office bomb, mainly due to World War II
 cutting off the European and Asian markets overseas.
 It eventually made a profit in its 1945 reissue, and is considered one of the greatest animated films ever made,
 with a 100% rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes. The film and characters are still prevalent in popular culture,
 featuring at various Disney parks and in other forms of entertainment.
 In 1994, Pinocchio was added to the United States National Film Registry for being deemed "culturally, historically,
 or aesthetically significant".

Cinderella is a 1950 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney.
 Based on the fairy tale of the same name by Charles Perrault, it is the 12th Disney animated feature film.
 The film was directed by Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, and Clyde Geronimi.
 Mack David, Jerry Livingston, and Al Hoffman wrote the songs, which include "Cinderella", "A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes",
 "Oh, Sing Sweet Nightingale", "The Work Song", "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo", and "So This is Love".
 It features the voices of Ilene Woods, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton, Rhoda Williams, James MacDonald, Luis van Rooten, Don Barclay,
 Mike Douglas, William Phipps, and Lucille Bliss.
During the early 1940s, Walt Disney Productions had suffered financially after losing connections to the European film markets due
 to the outbreak of World War II.
 Because of this, the studio endured box office bombs such as Pinocchio, Fantasia, and Bambi, all of which would later become
 more successful with several re-releases in theaters and on home video.
 By 1947, the studio was over $4 million in debt and was on the verge of bankruptcy.
 Walt Disney and his animators returned to feature film production in 1948 after producing a string of package films with the
 idea of adapting Charles Perrault's Cendrillon into an animated film.
After two years in production, Cinderella was released by RKO Radio Pictures on February 15, 1950.
 It became the greatest critical and commercial hit for the Disney studio since the first full-length animated film Snow
 White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and helped reverse the studio's fortunes.
 It received three Academy Award nominations, including Best Music, Original Song for "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo".
Decades later, it was followed by two direct-to-video sequels, Cinderella II: Dreams Come True (2002) and Cinderella III:
 A Twist in Time (2007), and a 2015 live-action adaptation directed by Kenneth Branagh.
 The castle featured in the film has become an icon of The Walt Disney Company, serving as a basis for the production
 logo of Walt Disney Pictures. A real life construction of the castle was built at the Magic Kingdom park at Walt Disney World,
 as well at Tokyo Disneyland.

Peter Pan is a 1953 American animated adventure fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and based on the 1904 play Peter Pan,
 or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up by J. M. Barrie.
 Directed by Clyde Geronimi, Hamilton Luske and Wilfred Jackson, it is the 14th Disney animated feature film.
 Starring the voices of Bobby Driscoll, Kathryn Beaumont, Hans Conried, Paul Collins, Heather Angel, and Bill Thompson,
 the film's plot involves a group of kids who meet Peter Pan and travel to the island of Never Land to stay young, where
 Peter also attempts to evade Captain Hook.
The film was entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival, and was originally released on February 5, 1953 by RKO Radio Pictures.
 Peter Pan was the final Disney animated feature released through RKO before Walt Disney founded his own distribution company,
 as well as the final Disney film in which all nine members of Disney's Nine Old Men worked together as directing animators.
 A sequel titled Return to Never Land was released in 2002, and a series of direct-to-DVD prequels produced by Disneytoon
 Studios focusing on Tinker Bell began in 2008.

In the Pride Lands of Africa, a pride of lions rule over the animal kingdom from Pride Rock.
 King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi present their newborn son, Simba, to the gathering animals by Rafiki the mandrill, the kingdom's shaman and advisor.
Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the "circle of life," which connects all living things.
 Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne and plots to get rid of Mufasa and Simba so that he may become king.
 He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala into exploring a forbidden elephants' graveyard, where they are chased by three hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed.
 Mufasa is alerted by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs.
 Though upset with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba.
 Meanwhile, Scar visits the hyenas and convinces them to help him overthrow Mufasa in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands.
Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede that will trample him.
 He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing that the king will rush to save his son.
 Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge, Scar throws Mufasa back into the stampede and to his death.
 Scar then convinces Simba that the tragedy was the latter's own fault and advises him to leave the kingdom and never return.
 He also orders the hyenas to kill Simba, but he escapes.
 Scar tells the pride that the stampede killed Mufasa and Simba and steps forward as the new king, allowing the hyenas' clan to live in the Pride Lands.
Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog, rescue Simba, who has collapsed in a desert.
 Simba grows up with his two new friends in their oasis, living a carefree life under the motto "hakuna matata".
 A grown-up Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala.
 She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that the Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign.
 Still feeling guilty over Mufasa's death, Simba refuses and storms off.
 He encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba.
 Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his rightful place as king.
 Realizing that he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.
Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar.
 Scar taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa.
 Enraged, Simba forces him to tell the truth to the rest of the pride.
 Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at a ledge near the top of Pride Rock.
 Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame his crimes on the hyenas;
 Simba spares his life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever, but throws him off after Scar attacks him again.
 The hyenas, who have overheard Scar's intention of betraying them, angrily maul him to death.
 Simba reclaims leadership and Nala becomes his queen.
With the Pride Lands restored, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.

A group of living toys, who assume lifelessness around humans, are preparing to move into a new house with their 
owner Andy Davis, his sister Molly and their single mother.
 The toys become uneasy when Andy has his birthday party a week early; to calm them, Sheriff Woody,
 Andy's favorite toy and their leader, sends Sarge and his green army men to spy on the gift opening with a baby monitor.
 The other toys (which include Mr.
 Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Rex the tyrannosaur, Hamm the piggy bank, and Bo Peep the porcelain doll)
 are relieved when Andy receives nothing that could replace them.
 Andy then receives a last-minute surprise gift – a Buzz Lightyear action figure who believes he is a real space ranger.
 Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features and becomes Andy's new favorite, making Woody jealous.
Two days before the move, Andy's family plans for a dinner at Pizza Planet, where Andy is allowed to bring along only one toy.
 To ensure Andy chooses him and not Buzz, Woody tries to use the radio-controlled car RC to knock Buzz behind the desk,
 but accidentally knocks him out a window instead. The other toys 
believe Woody deliberately tried to kill Buzz, but Andy arrives and takes Woody before they can exact revenge.
 A vengeful Buzz stows away in the car, and confronts Woody when the car stops at a gas station on the way to Pizza Planet.
 The two fight, fall out of the car, and are left behind.
After a further argument, the two hitch a ride on a Pizza Planet delivery truck and sneak into the restaurant.
 Buzz mistakenly believes a claw crane full of Little Green Men to be a true rocket, and Woody climbs in after him.
 Andy's sadistic next-door neighbor Sid spots and captures the two and takes them to his house, where they encounter
 his Bull Terrier Scud and his much-abused "mutant" toys made from parts of other toys he has destroyed.
As Woody tries to find an escape route, Buzz is shocked by a TV commercial that reveals he is indeed a toy.
 In denial, he attempts to fly, but breaks his arm off and falls into despair.
 After Sid's toys fix Buzz, Sid returns and tapes Buzz to a rocket, but a thunderstorm forces him to delay the launch until the next morning.
 Overnight, Woody helps Buzz realize that his purpose is making Andy happy, restoring Buzz's resolve.
 Sid takes Buzz out to launch him, but Woody rallies the mutant toys to frighten Sid into never harming toys again, freeing Buzz.
Woody and Buzz pursue Andy's moving truck, but Scud sees them and gives chase, biting Woody.
 Buzz fights off Scud, while Woody, freed, climbs into the truck and pushes RC out, using him to distract Scud and rescue Buzz.
 The other toys, thinking Woody is now trying to get rid of RC, toss Woody back into the street.
 Having escaped Scud, Buzz and Woody pursue the truck on RC, and the other toys spot them coming and realize their error.
 During the chase, RC's batteries run out, forcing Woody to ignite the rocket still strapped to Buzz.
 As they launch towards the truck, they become airborne, and Woody drops RC into the truck.
 Buzz opens his wings to sever the tape just before the rocket explodes;
 he and Woody glide over the truck and fall through the sunroof of Andy's car, landing safely beside Andy.
At Christmas, in the new house, Sarge and his men spy on the gift opening again while the other toys wait.
 Mr. Potato Head is delighted when Molly gets a Mrs. Potato Head, and Woody and Buzz jokingly ponder what gift could 
be "worse" than Buzz, only to nervously smile at each other when Andy gets a dachshund puppy.

In the late 1880s, a British couple and their infant son are shipwrecked off the Congolese coast.
 The adults build a treehouse but are killed by Sabor, a leopard.
 Kala, a female gorilla who recently lost her own child to Sabor, finds the human infant and takes him back to the jungle to raise as her own, naming him Tarzan.
 Kerchak, her mate and the gorilla troop's leader, strongly disapproves.
Years later, Tarzan begins to befriend other animals, including a young female gorilla named Terk and the paranoid male elephant, Tantor.
 Tarzan finds himself treated differently because of his different physique, so he makes great efforts to improve himself.
 As an adult, when Sabor attacks the gorillas again, Tarzan manages to kill Sabor with his crafted crude spear, gaining Kerchak's reluctant respect.
The gorilla troop's peaceful life is interrupted by the arrival of a team of human explorers from England, consisting of Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, his daughter, Jane, and their hunter escort Clayton, who are looking to study gorillas.
 Jane accidentally becomes separated from the group and is chased by a mandrill troop, until Tarzan saves her out of sheer curiosity.
 He realizes that she is human, just like he is.
 Jane leads Tarzan back to their camp, where Porter and Clayton both take great interest in him; the former in terms of scientific progress, while the latter hopes to have Tarzan lead the group to the gorillas.
 Despite Kerchak's warnings to avoid the strangers, Tarzan repeatedly returns to the camp.
 Porter, Clayton, and Jane teach him to speak English properly, and tell him what the human world is like.
 Tarzan and Jane begin to fall in love;
 however, she has difficulty convincing Tarzan to lead the humans to the gorillas, as Tarzan fears Kerchak would hurt them.
The explorers' ship soon returns to retrieve them. Jane asks Tarzan to return with them to England, but Tarzan, in turn, asks Jane to stay with him when Jane says it is unlikely they will ever return.
 Clayton convinces Tarzan that Jane will stay with him forever as long as he leads them to the gorillas; Tarzan agrees, and leads the trio to the nesting grounds while Terk and Tantor lure Kerchak.
 Porter and Jane are excited to mingle with the gorillas, but Kerchak returns and attacks the humans on sight.
 Tarzan restrains Kerchak while the humans escape; afterwards, Kerchak coldly accuses Tarzan of disobeying him and betraying his family, causing Tarzan to flee in shame.
 Kala takes Tarzan to the treehouse where she found him, reveals his true past, and says that she wants him to be happy whatever he decides.
 Tarzan puts on his late father's suit, signifying his decision to go to England.
When Tarzan boards the ship with Jane and Porter the next day, they are ambushed by Clayton and his traitorous band of stowaway thugs.
 Clayton reveals his plans to capture and sell the gorillas for a fortune now that he knows where the nesting grounds are, and imprisons Tarzan, Jane, and Porter to prevent them from interfering.
 Tarzan manages to escape with the help of Terk and Tantor, and he returns to the jungle, rallying the animals to come to the aid of the gorillas and scare off the thugs. Clayton fatally shoots Kerchak and battles Tarzan across the treetops.
 Tarzan destroys Clayton’s rifle, causing him to attack Tarzan with his machete until Tarzan traps Clayton within a cluster of vines.
 As Clayton struggles to cut himself free, one of the vines gets wrapped around his neck; he eventually falls from the treetops, hanging himself to death.
 Kerchak, with his dying breath, finally accepts Tarzan as his son, and names him the leader of the gorilla troop.
The next day, Porter and Jane prepare to leave on the ship while Tarzan stays behind with the gorillas.
 As the ship leaves shore, Porter encourages his daughter to stay with the man she loves, and Jane jumps overboard to return to shore; Porter shortly follows her.
 The Porters reunite with Tarzan and his family, and embark on their new life together.

In 1720, while sailing to Port Royal, Jamaica aboard HMS Dauntless, Governor Weatherby Swann, his daughter Elizabeth and crew encounter a shipwreck and recover a boy, Will Turner.
 Elizabeth discovers a golden pirate medallion around his neck, and takes it.
 Eight years later, Lieutenant James Norrington is promoted to commodore and proposes to Elizabeth.
 Her corset makes her faint and fall into the sea, causing the medallion to emit a pulse. Captain Jack Sparrow, having just arrived in Port Royal to commandeer a ship, rescues Elizabeth.
 Norrington identifies Jack as a pirate, and a chase ensues. Jack encounters Will, now a blacksmith.
 They duel, and Jack is imprisoned. That night, the Black Pearl attacks Port Royal, searching for the medallion.
 The crew of the Pearl captures Elizabeth, taking her to meet Captain Barbossa.
 Elizabeth claims her last name is Turner to conceal her identity as the governor's daughter.
 Barbossa explains that the medallion is one of 882 gold pieces that his crew took from a treasure of Hernán Cortés on Isla de Muerta.
 This cursed Barbossa and his crew, turning them into immortals who appear skeletal in moonlight.
 Barbossa and his crew have returned all but one of the pieces, with Elizabeth's medallion being the final piece.
 Barbossa takes her prisoner, believing she is the daughter of William "Bootstrap Bill" Turner, whose blood is needed to lift the curse.
Will frees Jack to rescue Elizabeth, whom Will loves.
 Jack, the previous captain of the Black Pearl before Barbossa staged a mutiny, makes a deal with Will to reclaim his ship.
 The two commandeer HMS Interceptor, a small sloop-of-war, and head for Tortuga. There, Jack enlists Gibbs to help them assemble a crew.
 Chasing the Pearl to the Isla de Muerta, Will and Jack witness Barbossa sacrificing Elizabeth's blood and returning the final gold piece.
 The curse is not lifted because Elizabeth does not carry the blood of Bootstrap Bill, Will's father and a previous crewmate of the Pearl.
 Will rescues Elizabeth and brings her to the Interceptor, while Jack is captured by Barbossa and locked in the brig of the Pearl.
 The Pearl pursues the Interceptor, destroying the ship and taking Jack's crew hostage.
 Will makes a deal with Barbossa to release Elizabeth in exchange for his blood, but Barbossa exploits a loophole in the agreement, marooning Jack and Elizabeth on an island.
 Elizabeth makes a smoke signal, and Norrington brings the Dauntless to rescue Elizabeth and arrest Jack.
 Elizabeth asks Norrington to pursue the Pearl and save Will, convincing him by accepting Norrington's marriage proposal.
That night, the Dauntless arrives at Isla de Muerta.
 Jack tells Norrington he will lure the pirates out to be ambushed by the crew of the Dauntless, but instead persuades Barbossa's crew to attack the Dauntless before they lift the curse and lose their immortality.
 Elizabeth escapes the Dauntless and frees Jack's crew from the brig of the Pearl.
 They refuse to rescue Jack and Will, so Elizabeth sets out on her own while Jack's crew depart aboard the Pearl.
 Jack again switches sides, freeing Will and dueling Barbossa, while Elizabeth and Will fight off Barbossa's crewmen.
 When Barbossa stabs Jack, it is revealed that Jack took a piece of gold from the chest and is likewise cursed and unable to die.
 Jack shoots Barbossa, and Will returns both coins to the chest with his and Jack's blood on them.
 The curse is lifted; Barbossa dies from Jack's gunshot, and the rest of Barbossa's crew, no longer immortal, are arrested.
At Port Royal, Jack is to be hanged for piracy.
 Elizabeth diverts Norrington's attention while Will attempts a rescue, but Jack and Will are surrounded.
 Elizabeth intercedes and declares her love for Will. Governor Swann pardons Will and gives his blessing for Elizabeth to marry him.
 Jack dives into the sea and escapes aboard the nearby Pearl, reclaiming the ship and his new crew.
 Norrington permits Jack and the Pearl "one day's head start" before initiating pursuit.

In a world populated by anthropomorphic vehicles, the final race of the Piston Cup begins a rivalry between retiring veteran Strip "The King" Weathers, frequent runner-up Chick Hicks, and rookie sensation Lightning McQueen.
 At the back of the field, McQueen avoids a multi-car crash caused by Chick.
 While the rest of the running competitors pit for new tires under the pace car, McQueen stays out but blows out both rear tires on the last lap.
 Chick and the King catch up, resulting in a three-way tie.
 The tiebreaker race is scheduled for one week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway.
 McQueen is desperate to win the race, not only to be the first rookie to win the Piston Cup, but also because it would allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-Eze, a bumper ointment company, and take
 The King's place on the prestigious Dinoco team. However, he struggles to work with others due to his selfishness, which has caused him to fire three crew chiefs and having his pit crew quit after the race.
Eager to get to California as soon as possible, he pushes his big rig, Mack, to travel all night long.
 While McQueen is sleeping, Mack nods off and is startled awake by a gang of tuner cars, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road.
 McQueen wakes up in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway in search of Mack, but instead ends up in the rundown desert town of Radiator Springs, where he is chased by Sheriff and inadvertently damages the pavement of the main road.
 The next day, McQueen is ordered by the town judge and medical doctor, Doc Hudson, to leave town immediately, but the local lawyer, Sally, requests that McQueen should instead be assigned community service to repave the road by a machine, to which Doc reluctantly agrees.
 In a rush to leave, McQueen repaves the road shoddily. However, Doc is not satisfied, and he challenges McQueen to a race around Old Willie—if McQueen wins, he can leave.
 McQueen loses and is forced to start all over again.
During this time, he begins to warm up to the town and befriends several of its residents, including tow truck Mater, tire vendor Luigi, and his assistant Guido.
 He learns that Radiator Springs was once a popular stop along U.S. Route 66 until it was bypassed with the construction of Interstate 40 and mostly forgotten, and Doc was the Fabulous Hudson Hornet, a three-time Piston Cup champion whose career ended from a devastating crash in 1954.
 He bonds with Sally, who found happiness when she gave up a fast life in Los Angeles to live in Radiator Springs, and now dreams of putting the town back on the map.
 McQueen eventually repairs the road, reinvigorating the town's residents, and decides to spend an extra day in Radiator Springs with his new friends, but his time there is cut short when Mack and the media (including helicopters) descend on the town.
 McQueen reluctantly leaves to reach California in time for the race.
 At the same time, the brokenhearted Sally expresses her disappointment with Doc upon discovering that he was responsible for tipping off the media to McQueen's whereabouts.
 She and the others, dismayed about the departure of their new friend, go to sleep, while Doc quickly regrets his actions.
As he couldn't say goodbye to his friends at the race, McQueen races distractedly and ends up with one lap behind.
 He is then surprised to discover that Doc, having a change of heart, has taken over as his crew chief, and most friends from Radiator Springs are helping in the pit.
 Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen manages to recover and vaults into the lead.
 On the final lap, Chick performs a PIT maneuver and sends The King into a dangerous crash.
 Recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line and drives back to push The King over the line to finish his last race while Chick zooms by.
 As a result, the angered crowd and media condemn Chick's victory but praise McQueen's sportsmanship.
 Tex offers McQueen the Dinoco sponsorship, but he declines and insists on staying with Rust-Eze out of loyalty for their past support.
 Back at Radiator Springs, McQueen reunites with Sally and announces that he will be setting up his racing headquarters there, putting the town back on the map.
In a post-credits scene, Minny and Van, a couple trying to find the Interstate, are shown lost in the middle of the desert.

Dastan, a street urchin in Persia, is adopted by King Sharaman after showing courage.
 Fifteen years later, the king's brother Nizam relays evidence to the princes—Dastan, along
 with the king's biological sons Tus and Garsiv—that the holy city of Alamut is forging weapons for Persia's enemies.
 Tus directs the Persian army to capture Alamut. Dastan and his friends breach the city and open a gate for the siege.
 During the attack, Dastan defeats a royal guard and takes from him a sacred dagger.
Alamut falls to the Persians, but Princess Tamina denies that the city has any weapon forges.
 Tus asks her to marry him to unite the two nations, and she only accepts after seeing the dagger in Dastan's possession.
 At their celebratory banquet, Tus has Dastan give their father an embroidered robe.
 However, the robe is poisoned, fatally burning Sharaman. Garsiv accuses Dastan of the king's murder, but Dastan escapes with Tamina.
 Tus is appointed king and a bounty on Dastan’s head is set.
While in hiding, Tamina attempts to kill Dastan and steal the dagger, and in the struggle Dastan discovers the dagger enables
 the wielder to travel back in time. Dastan concludes that Tus invaded Alamut for the dagger, and decides to confront his brother
 at the funeral of the king in Avrat. On the way, the two are captured by merchant-bandits led by Sheik Amar who seeks the reward money, but they manage to escape. After arriving in Avrat, Dastan tries to convince Nizam of his innocence. Seeing burns on Nizam's hands, Dastan realizes that Nizam orchestrated the king's murder. Furthermore, Nizam has set up an ambush for Dastan along the Persian streets, but after a conflict with Garsiv, Dastan escapes. Nizam sends a group of covert warriors,
 the Hassansins, to kill Dastan and find the dagger.
During a sandstorm, Tamina tells Dastan that long ago,
 the gods unleashed a great sandstorm to destroy humanity but were moved by a young girl's offer to sacrifice
 herself in humanity's place and trapped the Sands of Time in a large sandglass. Tamina is the latest guardian of the dagger,
 given to the young girl by the gods, which can pierce the sandglass and potentially destroy the world but also enable the dagger's 
wielder to travel further back in time than the one minute's worth of sand the dagger holds.
 Dastan realizes that Nizam intends to travel back to his childhood, prevent himself from saving Sharaman from a lion attack,
 and grow up to become King of Persia in Sharaman's place. Amar captures the two again,
 but Dastan saves Amar's men from a Hassansin attack using the dagger.
 This convinces Amar to escort them to a sanctuary near the Hindu Kush, where
 Tamina will seal the dagger within the stone it first came from.
 At the sanctuary, they are found by Garsiv, whom Dastan convinces of his innocence,
 but the Hassansins ambush them, killing Garsiv and stealing the dagger.
Dastan's group travels back to Alamut to retrieve the dagger from Nizam and warn Tus of Nizam.
 Amar's right-hand man Seso dies retrieving the dagger for Dastan, who demonstrates the dagger's powers to Tus to convince him of the truth.
 Afterwards, Nizam interrupts them, kills Tus, and takes the dagger back.
 Tamina saves Dastan from being killed and the two head for the secret tunnels beneath the city that lead to the sandglass.
 When they reach Nizam, he stabs the sandglass and throws them both off a cliff.
 Tamina sacrifices herself, releasing Dastan's hand and falling to her death to allow him to fight Nizam.
Nizam thrusts the dagger into the esoterical column of sandglass under the temple.
 Dastan grabs hold of the hilt of the dagger together with Nizam; as sand is released from the sandglass, 
time rewinds to the moment Dastan found the dagger. He finds Tus and Garsiv and exposes Nizam's treachery.
 Nizam tries to kill Dastan, but Dastan easily defeats him yet spares him. Nizam gets up and attempts to
 attack again but is subdued and killed by Tus. Tus apologizes to Tamina for the siege and proposes to
 strengthen the two nations' bond by marital alliance of the Princess to Dastan. Dastan returns the dagger
 to Tamina as an engagement gift and tells her he looks forward to their future together.

A long time ago, a drop of magical sunlight falls from the sky and sprouts a flower with healing powers.
 Upon discovering it, an old beggar woman named Mother Gothel hides the flower and uses it to stay young
 for centuries, until royal soldiers from a nearby kingdom find and uproot it to save their pregnant and
 ill Queen. A few days later, the Queen gives birth to a baby princess with long golden hair. While the 
king and queen are sleeping one evening, Gothel discovers the hair has the same powers as the flower, but
 turns brown and becomes powerless when cut.
 She kidnaps the girl, names her Rapunzel, and raises her in a hidden tower in the woods, using her hair to stay young
Each year, on Rapunzel's birthday, the king and queen release thousands of sky lanterns in hopes she will see them and return home.
 Rapunzel becomes obsessed with the distant lights, and, on the eve of her 18th birthday, asks Gothel for permission to see them closer.
 Gothel claims that the outside world is too dangerous and Rapunzel is too weak and young to survive in it. Later, handsome thief
 Flynn Rider steals Rapunzel's intended crown from the palace, abandons his partners, the Stabbington Brothers, and takes refuge in the tower.
 Rapunzel knocks him out and hides him in a closet. She considers showing him to Gothel as proof she is capable of taking
 care of herself; however, Gothel refuses to let her broach the subject, so Rapunzel sends Gothel on a three-day journey to get new paints.
Rapunzel hides the crown, not realizing it is her own, and tells Flynn he can only get it back by taking her to see the lights.
 Along the way, they stop at the Snuggly Duckling pub, where menacing thugs try to capture the wanted Flynn.
 Rapunzel soon charms them into revealing their softer sides; when royal guards arrive, the thugs help her and Flynn to escape.
 Meanwhile, Gothel becomes suspicious, returns to the empty tower, and finds the crown.

 and Maximus reluctantly agrees, joining them as they go to the kingdom and take part in a festival in honor of the "lost princess".
 They spend the day celebrating with the townsfolk, then sail onto the lake to watch the solemn release of the lanterns firsthand.
 Having fulfilled her dream, Rapunzel gives Eugene back the crown. The two confess their love, and are about to kiss,
 when Eugene sees the Stabbington brothers. He walks off to apologize, and offers them the crown, but they tie him to a ship so the
 royal guards will arrest him and Rapunzel will think he abandoned her.
 They then try to capture Rapunzel, but Gothel stages a "rescue" and takes Rapunzel home.
Eugene escapes with the help of Maximus and the pub thugs.
 Meanwhile, Rapunzel realizes she has subconsciously incorporated the kingdom's standard into her artwork all her life;
 finally understanding that she is the "lost princess", she confronts Gothel.
 Eugene arrives at the tower, climbing up Rapunzel's hair, but then discovers her bound and gagged.
 Gothel fatally stabs him, and tries to drag Rapunzel to a new hiding place.
 Rapunzel offers to stop struggling and go willingly, if Gothel will allow her to heal Eugene.
 Realizing this means Rapunzel will grow old and die in Gothel's clutches, Eugene cuts off Rapunzel's hair before she can heal him.
 Gothel begins to age rapidly and turns to dust as she falls out of the tower.
Rapunzel mourns the death of Eugene, and one of her tears saves his life, still having some of the sun's power in it.
 Eugene reunites Rapunzel with her real parents, is fully pardoned for his crimes, and he and Rapunzel are married as the kingdom celebrates.

In Medieval Scotland, Princess Merida of the clan Dunbroch is given a bow and arrow by her father,
 King Fergus for her sixth birthday to the dismay of her mother, Queen Elinor.
 While venturing into the woods to fetch an arrow, Merida encounters a will-o'-the-wisp.
 Soon afterward, Mor'du, a huge demon bear, attacks the family.
 Merida flees on horseback with Elinor, while Fergus and his men fend off Mor'du, though the fight costs him one of his legs.
Ten years later, Merida, now sixteen years old, discovers that she is to be betrothed to the son of one of her father's allies.
 Elinor explains that failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch, reminding Merida of a legend of a prince whose
 pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes destroyed his kingdom.
The allied clan chieftains and their first-born sons arrive to compete 
in the Highland games for Merida's hand in marriage. Merida twists the rules, announcing that as her own clan's firstborn
 she is eligible to compete for her own hand. She easily bests her suitors in an archery contest, shaming the other clans, and
 after a heated disagreement with Elinor, runs away into the forest. Wisps appear, leading her to the hut of an elderly witch.
 Merida bargains for a spell to change her fate, and the witch gives her an enchanted cake.
When Merida gives Elinor the cake, it transforms her into a bear, unable to speak but still retaining most of her human consciousness.
 Merida returns to the witch's cottage with Elinor, only to find it deserted, and discovers a message from the witch:
 unless Merida is able to "mend the bond torn by pride" before the second sunrise, the spell will become permanent.
 Merida and Elinor are led by the wisps to ancient ruins, where they encounter Mor'du.
 Realizing that Mor'du was the prince in the legend, Merida vows that she will not let the same thing happen to her mother,
 and concludes she needs to repair the family tapestry she damaged during their argument.
They return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war. Merida intends to relent and declare herself ready to choose a
 suitor as tradition demands, but Elinor prompts her instead to insist that the firstborns should be allowed to marry in their own
 time to whomever they choose. The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing and strengthening their alliance.
Merida sneaks into the tapestry room with Elinor, while Fergus, looking for his wife finds out she's gone.
 Elinor, who is losing her humanity, attacks Fergus, but suddenly regains her composure and flees the castle.
 Mistaking the queen for Mor'du and thinking it has eaten his wife, Fergus pursues the bear with the other clans,
 locking Merida in the castle. Merida escapes with the assistance of her identical triplet brothers, Harris, Hubert, and Hamish,
 who have also eaten the enchanted cake and are now bear cubs. Merida repairs the tapestry and rides out after her father.
 Fergus and the clans capture Elinor, but Merida thwarts them before the real Mor'du arrives.
 Mor'du batters the clan warriors and targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, holding off Mor'du and causing him to be crushed by a falling menhir.
 This releases the spirit of the prince, who silently thanks Merida for freeing him and transforms into a wisp.
 Merida covers her mother in the repaired tapestry, but she remains a bear.
 As the sun rises for the second time, Merida realizes the mistakes she has made and reconciles with Elinor, unknowingly fulfilling the
 true meaning of the witch's message and reversing the spell's effects on her mother and brothers.
With Mor'du gone, Merida and Elinor work together on a new tapestry when they are called to the docks to bid farewell to the other clans,
 and ride their horses together.

Whenever Litwak's Arcade closes, the various video game characters leave their in-game roles and socialize via a power strip.
 At a support group, Wreck-it Ralph, the villain of Fix-it Felix, Jr., expresses frustration with his assigned role, as he
 is mistreated by his game's NPCs while Felix is celebrated.
 When Ralph is excluded from the game's thirtieth-anniversary party, he determines to win a medal and earn some respect.
Overhearing that players in the first-person shooter Hero's Duty can earn medals, Ralph sneaks in and steals one while the game's
 characters are fighting Cy-Bugs, an insectoid enemy. Ralph accidentally launches himself in an escape shuttle with a Cy-Bug inside
 and crash-lands in the candy-themed kart racing game Sugar Rush. With Ralph gone, his game is labeled out of order.
 Felix leaves the game to find Ralph, allying with Sergeant Calhoun, the heroine of Hero's Duty, as she tracks the Cy-Bug,
 which may become a virus.
In Sugar Rush, Vanellope von Schweetz steals Ralph's medal and uses it to buy her way into the nightly race that determines which
 characters are playable the next day. King Candy forbids her to race, as she has a glitch that causes her to move and teleport erratically.
 Other racers destroy her kart until Ralph intervenes. Vanellope promises to get the medal back if Ralph helps her win;
 he reluctantly helps her build a new kart and teaches her to drive inside Diet Cola Mountain.
Calhoun and Felix arrive in Sugar Rush, and Felix explains that long ago,
 the titular hero of Turbo Time became jealous of the new racing game RoadBlasters, and tried to sabotage it, causing both games to be unplugged.
 Felix fears Ralph might be "going Turbo", too. Calhoun and Felix fall into Nesquik-sand, work together to escape, and begin to fall in love.
Meanwhile, King Candy hacks into Sugar Rush's source code and retrieves the medal,
 giving it back to Ralph. He warns that, if Vanellope becomes a playable character, her glitching might cause someone to
 unplug the game as 'broken'. Ralph decides he cannot allow Vanellope to race and destroys her kart. She breaks down in tears and runs away,
 labeling Ralph a true "bad guy". Calhoun abandons Felix when he inadvertently reminds her of her late fiance.
 Felix is captured at the palace by King Candy's assistant, Sour Bill, while Calhoun wanders the game alone, discovering the Cy-bug has
 multiplied exponentially.
Heartbroken and remorseful, Ralph returns to Fix-it Felix, Jr. and finds it abandoned.
 He angrily throws his medal, then notices that the Sugar Rush cabinet displays Vanellope as a playable character.
 Returning to Sugar Rush, Ralph interrogates Sour Bill, who admits that King Candy disconnected Vanellope's code and locked away
 the memories of the Sugar Rush characters so that no one knows her actual role. He explains that if Vanellope completes a race,
 all of King Candy's changes will be deleted and the game restored to normal.
Ralph frees Felix from King Candy's prison, fixes the kart, and reconciles with Vanellope,
 who enters the race. The Cy-Bugs emerge and start destroying the game; Calhoun, Felix, and Ralph help evacuate the characters.
 Unaware of this development, King Candy attempts to ram Vanellope off the track, causing her to glitch.
 She reveals King Candy to be Turbo, who took over Sugar Rush when his game was unplugged.
 Vanellope flees as Turbo is eaten by a Cy-Bug, which fuses with him into an insectoid monster.
Everyone but Vanellope evacuates, as glitches cannot leave their games. Remembering from Hero's Duty that
 a beacon will draw and destroy the Cy-Bugs, Ralph battles Turbo and collapses the Mentos roof of Diet Cola Mountain,
 creating an eruption which destroys Turbo and the Cy-Bugs. Vanellope rescues Ralph and crosses the finish line.
 The game resets, revealing her as the ruler of Sugar Rush, though she keeps her glitching ability, considering it an advantage.
Ralph returns to his game, content with his role as "villain" and respected by his fellow characters.
 Felix and Calhoun marry, and Ralph watches Vanellope become Sugar Rush's favorite character.

As a first grader, Mike Wazowski begins to dream of becoming a Scarer - a monster who enters the human world at night to scare
 children and harvest their screams for energy to power the city of Monstropolis. Eleven years later, Mike enrolls in the Scaring
 program at Monsters University (MU) and meets classmate James P. "Sulley" Sullivan.
 Abigail Hardscrabble, dean of MU, warns the students that anyone who does not pass a final exam at the end of the first semester
 will have to leave the Scaring program.
As the semester progresses, an intense rivalry forms between Mike, who studies hard to improve himself, and Sulley,
 who relies only on his natural talent and begins to falter. They both attempt to join a fraternity, but only Sulley is accepted into
 Roar Omega Roar (ROR), the most prestigious house on campus.
 At the final exam, a fight between the duo inadvertently destroys Hardscrabble’s prize scream canister.
 Hardscrabble tests them separately and fails them both -- Mike for not being scary, Sulley for choosing the wrong approach to scare a child
 without having all the relevant information about them. They are forced to transfer to a different study program, much to their dismay.
Wanting to prove himself, Mike learns of MU's "Scare Games" competition and makes a deal with Hardscrabble.
 If his team wins, all of the members will be admitted to the Scaring program, otherwise, he will leave MU.
 Mike joins Oozma Kappa (OK), a fraternity of misfits, but they are one member short of being able to enter the competition.
 Sulley offers to join OK, seeing it as his only chance to return to Scaring, and Mike reluctantly accepts.
OK finishes last in the first round but are saved from elimination after another team is disqualified for cheating.
 During each of the next three rounds, OK steadily improves due to Mike's knowledge of scaring and the others' unique talents.
 Despite their progress, they face humiliation by rival fraternities, and Hardscrabble questions whether Sulley believes that Mike can be
 an effective Scarer. Though OK earns a decisive victory over ROR in the final round,
 Mike discovers afterward that Sulley had tampered with the simulator settings to guarantee a win for OK, causing a heated argument
 between the two. The other OK members discard their trophy, equally ashamed that Sulley ruined their victory by cheating.
 Sulley confesses to Hardscrabble what he has done.
Outraged at Sulley's betrayal and still determined to prove that he can become a Scarer,
 Mike breaks into the school's door lab and enters the human world.
 He emerges in a summer camp cabin full of children but is unable to scare any of them and flees into the woods.
 With assistance from the OK members, Sulley sneaks through the door to find Mike,
 ignoring Hardscrabble's order to stay away from it and let the authorities handle the situation.
 Sulley finds Mike and tells him that the reason why he cheated was because he was afraid of failing his team and everyone on the campus
 all because Mike was not scary and admits that despite being a Sullivan, he's not as great of a success as his family.
 The two reconcile and try to return to MU, but find out that Hardscrabble has deactivated the door.
As police officers begin to chase Mike and Sulley, Mike realizes that they may be able to power the door from their side.
 Working together, the two scare the officers so badly that their screams overload the door, then return to MU just as it explodes.
 Mike and Sulley are punished and expelled from MU for their actions,
 but the remaining OK members are admitted into the Scaring program for the coming semester,
 impressing Hardscrabble for their performance in the Scare Games.
As Mike and Sulley are leaving the campus, Hardscrabble admits that they have surprised her and expresses her hope that they
 will continue to do so in the future. Seeing a "help wanted" advertisement for job openings at Monsters, Inc.,
 the two decide to apply and are hired to work in the mailroom.
 They work their way up to different jobs before being scarer and scare assistant respectively.

Princess Elsa of Arendelle possesses magical powers that allow her to control and create ice and snow,
 often using them to play with her younger sister, Anna. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic,
 their parents, the King and Queen, take both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie.
 He heals Anna but alters her memories so that she forgets about Elsa's magic.
 Grand Pabbie warns Elsa that she must learn to control her powers and that fear will be her greatest enemy.
 The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle, closing the castle gates to their subjects.
 To protect her sister from her increasingly unpredictable powers, Elsa ceases all contact with Anna, creating a rift between them.
 When the sisters are adults, their parents are killed at sea during a storm.
Following her 21st birthday, Elsa is to be crowned queen of Arendelle.
 She is afraid that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her.
 The castle gates open to the public and visiting dignitaries for the first time in years.
 Among them are the scheming Duke of Weselton and the handsome Prince Hans of the Southern Isles, with whom Anna falls in love at first sight.
 Elsa's coronation takes place without incident, but she remains distant from Anna.
 Anna and Hans develop a romantic connection during the coronation festivities, and he impulsively proposes to her,
 but Elsa objects when they seek her blessing. Hurt and confused, Anna protests, begging Elsa to explain her fear and isolation.
 The emotional strain causes Elsa to accidentally unleash her powers before the court.
 Branded a monster by the Duke, Elsa flees to the North Mountain, where she finally acknowledges her powers,
 building an ice palace to live a hermit life.
 In the process, her magic unintentionally engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter.
Anna ventures out to find Elsa and end the winter, leaving Hans in command.
 She gets lost, collecting supplies at Wandering Oaken's shop. She meets an iceman named Kristoff and his reindeer,
 Sven, convincing them to take her to the mountains. An attack by wolves leads to Kristoff's sleigh being destroyed.
 When Anna's horse returns to Arendelle without her, Hans sets out to find Anna and Elsa, accompanied by the Duke's minions,
 who have secret orders to kill Elsa. Reaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa. When Anna reveals what has become of Arendelle,
 a horrified Elsa confesses she does not know how to undo her magic. Her fear causes her powers to manifest themselves once more,
 and she accidentally freezes Anna's heart, seriously injuring her. In desperation to keep Anna safe,
 Elsa creates a giant snow monster named Marshmallow, who chases Anna and Kristoff away.
 Realizing the effects of Elsa's spell on Anna, Kristoff takes her to the trolls, his adoptive family.
 Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless "an act of true love" reverses the spell.
Kristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss. Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace; defeating Marshmallow
 (who falls into a chasm) and capturing Elsa. Anna is delivered to Hans, but rather than kissing her, Hans instead reveals that he has
 actually been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters.
 Hans locks a heartbroken Anna in a room to die and then manipulates the dignitaries into believing that Elsa killed her,
 but not before they were married. He orders the queen's execution, only to discover she has escaped her detention cell.
 Anna is freed by Olaf, her childhood talking snowman companion, and they venture into the blizzard outside to meet Kristoff,
 who Olaf has revealed is in love with her. Hans confronts Elsa outside, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa 
to break down and abruptly stop the storm. Anna spots Hans about to kill Elsa; she leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans.
 Devastated, Elsa hugs and mourns over her sister, who thaws out, her heroism constituting "an act of true love".
Realizing that love is the key to controlling her magic, Elsa ends the winter.
 Hans is arrested and exiled from the kingdom for his treason and attempted assassination,
 while the Duke's trade links with Arendelle are cut off. Anna gives Kristoff a new sleigh and the two kiss.
 The sisters are reunited, and Elsa promises never to lock the castle gates again.
In a post-credits scene, Marshmallow, having survived the fall, finds Elsa's discarded crown and places it on top of its head.

Within the mind of a young girl named Riley are the basic emotions that control her actions:
 Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. Her experiences become memories, stored as colored orbs,
 which are sent into long-term memory each night. The aspects of five most important "core memories"
 within her personality incorporate the form of floating islands.
 Joy acts as the leader, and she and the rest of the emotions try to limit Sadness's influence.
At the age of 11, Riley moves from Minnesota to San Francisco for her father's new job.
 She at first has poor experiences; the new house is cramped and old, her father hardly has any time for her,
 a local pizza parlor only serves pizza topped with broccoli (which Riley dislikes),
 and the moving van with their belongings ends up in Texas and will not arrive for weeks.
 On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness retroactively turns joyous memories sad,
 which causes Riley to cry in front of her class and creates a sad core memory.
 Joy tries to dispose of it by using a vacuum tube but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness,
 disabling the personality islands.
 Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters.
In Joy and Sadness's absence, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are forced to take control of Riley with disastrous results,
 distancing Riley from her parents, friends, and hobbies. Because of this, her personality islands gradually crumble
 and fall into the "Memory Dump", where memories are forgotten.
 Finally, Anger resolves to return to Minnesota, believing it will restore her happiness.
While navigating the vast long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong,
 Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the "train of thought" back to Headquarters.
 The three, after extreme inconvenience caused by the islands' dissolution, eventually catch the train but it halts when Riley falls asleep,
 then derails entirely with the collapse of another island. Desperate, Joy abandons Sadness and tries to ride a "recall tube"
 back to the Headquarters but the ground below the tube collapses, breaking and sending Joy and Bing Bong plunging into the Memory Dump.
 After discovering a sad memory that turned happy in Riley's parents' comfort to her,
 Joy understands Sadness's purpose: alerting others when Riley is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help.
 Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong's old wagon rocket, which gets energy when the rider sings, to escape the Memory Dump,
 but are unable to fly high enough due to their combined weight.
 On their last attempt, Bing Bong jumps out to allow Joy to escape as he fades away.
Joy reunites with Sadness and they return to Headquarters, but arrive too late as Anger's idea has disabled the console,
 rendering Riley apathetic as she boards a bus to Minnesota. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness,
 who is able to reactivate it and prompt Riley to return to her new home. As Sadness reinstalls the core memories,
 transforming them from happy to sad, Riley tearfully confesses to her parents that she misses her old life and breaks down in tears.
 Her parents comfort her and admit they also miss Minnesota. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory consisting
 of happiness and sadness;
 a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco.
A year later, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and returned to her old hobbies while acquiring a few new ones.
 Inside Headquarters, her emotions admire Riley's new personality islands, and all work together on a newly expanded console with
 room for them all.

Mowgli, a young orphan boy, is found in a basket in the deep jungles of India by Bagheera, a black panther who promptly takes him to Raksha,
 a mother wolf who has just had cubs. She and her mate, Rama, raise him along with their own cubs and after ten years, Mowgli becomes well
 acquainted with jungle life and plays with his wolf siblings.
 Bagheera is pleased with how happy Mowgli is now, but also worries that Mowgli must eventually return to his own kind.
One night, the wolf pack parents meet at Council Rock, having learned that Shere Khan, a man-eating Bengal tiger, has returned to the
 pack's part of the jungle. Pack leader Akela decides that Mowgli must leave the jungle for his own safety.
 Bagheera volunteers to escort him to a "Man-Village". They leave that very night, but Mowgli is determined to stay in the jungle.
 He and Bagheera rest in a tree for the night, where Kaa, a hungry Indian python, tries to devour Mowgli, but Bagheera intervenes.
 The next morning, Mowgli tries to join the elephant patrol, led by Colonel Hathi and his wife Winifred. Bagheera finds Mowgli, but after a
 fight, decides to leave Mowgli on his own. Mowgli soon meets up with the laid-back, fun-loving sloth bear Baloo, who promises to raise Mowgli
 himself and never take him to the Man-Village.
Shortly afterward, a group of monkeys kidnap Mowgli and take him to their leader, King Louie the orangutan.
 King Louie offers to help Mowgli stay in the jungle if he will tell Louie how to make fire, like other humans.
 However, since he was not raised by humans, Mowgli does not know how to make fire.
 Bagheera and Baloo arrive to rescue Mowgli and in the ensuing chaos, King Louie's palace is demolished to rubble.
 Bagheera speaks to Baloo that night and convinces him that the jungle will never be safe for Mowgli with Shere Khan around.
 In the morning, Baloo reluctantly explains to Mowgli that the Man-Village is best for him, but Mowgli accuses him of breaking his
 promise and runs away. As Baloo sets off in search of Mowgli, Bagheera rallies the help of Hathi and his patrol.
 However, Shere Khan himself, who was eavesdropping on Bagheera and Hathi's conversation, is now determined to hunt and kill Mowgli himself.
Meanwhile, Mowgli encounters Kaa once again, who again attempts to eat him after hypnotizing him to sleep,
 but he wakes up and escapes thanks to the unwitting intervention of the suspicious Shere Khan. As a storm gathers,
 a depressed Mowgli encounters a group of friendly vultures who accept Mowgli as a fellow outcast. Shere Khan appears shortly after,
 scaring off the vultures and confronting Mowgli. Baloo rushes to the rescue and tries to keep Shere Khan away from Mowgli, but is nearly killed.
 When lightning strikes a nearby tree and sets it ablaze, the vultures swoop in to distract Shere Khan, while Mowgli grabs a
 large flaming branch and ties it to the tiger's tail.
 Shere Khan, who is terrified of fire, panics and runs away.
Bagheera and Baloo take Mowgli to the edge of the Man-Village,
 but Mowgli is still hesitant to go there. However, his mind abruptly changes when he is smitten by a beautiful young girl
 named Shanti from the village who is coming down by the riverside to fetch water. After noticing Mowgli, she "accidentally" drops her water pot.
 Mowgli retrieves it for her and follows her into the Man-Village.
 After Mowgli shrugs to Baloo and Bagheera, to show that he has made up his mind and chosen to go to the Man-Village,
 Baloo and Bagheera decide to head home, content that Mowgli is safe and happy with his own kind.

On the Polynesian island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess of nature Te Fiti,
 who brought life to the ocean long ago using a pounamu stone as her heart and the source of her power.
 Maui, the shape-shifting demigod of the wind and sea and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation.
 However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked offshore by Te Kā, a volcanic demon.
 He loses both his magical giant fishhook and the heart to the depths of the sea.
A thousand years later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui,
 to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui and Sina, Moana's mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her to become the island's chief.
 Sixteen years later, a blight strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch.
 Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish and find out what is happening, but Tui forbids it.
 Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked back to Motunui.
That afternoon, Moana's grandmother, Tala, shows her a secret cave of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole
 Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te Kā's darkness is poisoning the island,
 but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and has him restore the heart of Te Fiti. Having been given the heart of Te Fiti by the ocean,
 Tala gives it to Moana. Tala later falls ill and, on her deathbed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.
Setting sail on a camakau from the cavern along with the hen named Heihei, Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island
 where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave.
 She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora—coconut pirates—who seek the heart,
 but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces
 him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical fishhook in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa,
 a giant coconut crab. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook, only to find himself unable to control his shape-shifting.
 He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook.
 Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents abandoned him as an infant, and the gods, 
taking pity on him, granted him his powers.
 After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.
They arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te Kā. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged.
 Unwilling to lose his hook in another confrontation with Te Kā, Maui abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else
 to restore the heart and loses hope. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling.
 She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te Kā. Maui returns,
 having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te Kā, destroying his hook in the process.
 Upon being unable to find Te Fiti, Moana realizes Te Kā is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart.
 The ocean clears a path for Moana, allowing her to return the heart to Te Fiti, who heals the ocean and islands of the blight.
 Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who fixes his hook and decorates Moana's boat with flowers before falling into a deep sleep and becoming an island.
Moana bids farewell to Maui and Te Fiti, returning home where she reunites with her parents. She takes up her role as chief and wayfinder,
 leading her people as they resume voyaging with Maui flying over them in Hawk form.
In a post-credits scene, Tamatoa, still stuck on his back, addresses the audience, knowing they would help if he was named Sebastian.

An enchantress disguised as an old beggar woman arrives at a castle during a ball and offers the host,
 a cruel and selfish prince, an enchanted rose in return for shelter from a storm. When he refuses the offer,
 the enchantress reveals her true form and transforms the prince into a beast and his servants into household
 objects before erasing the castle, himself, and his servants from the memories of their loved ones and everyone
 else in the town. She warns the prince that the curse will be broken, only if he can learn to love another and have
 that person love him in return by the time the last petal of the rose falls, or else he will remain a beast for the
 rest of his life while his servants become inanimate.
Several years later, in the small town of Villeneuve, Belle, the book-loving daughter of a widowed artist named Maurice,
 dreams of adventure. She constantly brushes off advances from Gaston, an arrogant war veteran as he is not the type of
 man Belle wishes to marry. On Maurice's way to the market, he becomes lost in the forest and after narrowly escaping a
 pack of wolves he seeks refuge in the Beast's castle. However, the Beast imprisons him when he "stole" a rose from his
 garden as a gift to Belle. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search of him, and finds him
 locked in the castle dungeon. Belle asks the Beast to let her take his place; the Beast agrees and drags Maurice away.
Belle befriends the castle's servants, including candelabra/footman Lumiere, mantel clock/majordomo Cogsworth,
 feather-duster/maid Plumette, teapot/housekeeper Mrs. Potts, and her son, Chip, who is now a teacup.
 They invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast
 scares her into the woods. Belle is ambushed off-guard by the wolves from earlier, but the Beast rescues her, injuring
 himself in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a spark develops between them. The Beast shows Belle a gift from the
 enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they want. Belle uses the book to visit her childhood home in Paris,
 where she discovers a plague doctor's mask and realizes that she and her father were forced to leave when her mother succumbed
 to the Bubonic plague, the one thing her father couldn't tell her all those years.
In Villeneuve, Maurice fails to convince the other villagers of the Beast and Belle's imprisonment.
 Gaston, seeing rescuing Belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage, agrees to help Maurice.
 When Maurice learns of his ulterior motive and rejects him, Gaston abandons him to be eaten by the wolves.
 Maurice is rescued by the town hermit Agathe, but when he tells the townsfolk of Gaston's crime and is unable to provide solid evidence,
 Gaston convinces them to send Maurice to an insane asylum.
After sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father's predicament using a magic mirror.
 The Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. Arriving back to the town,
 Belle reveals the Beast in the mirror much to the shock of the townsfolk, proving her father's sanity.
 Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, a jealous Gaston claims she has been charmed by dark magic and has her thrown into
 the asylum carriage with her father. He rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast before he
 "curses" the whole village. Inside the asylum carriage, Belle tells her father that she already knows what happened to
 her mother and showed him the rose rattle she took from her magical visit to their old, abandoned home.
 Maurice and Belle escape, and Belle rushes back to the castle.
During the battle, Gaston abandons his companion LeFou, who then sides with the servants to fend off the villagers.
 Meanwhile, he attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return.
 He overwhelms Gaston, but spares his life at the last second before reuniting with Belle.
 However, Gaston treacherously shoots the Beast from a bridge, which then collapses as the castle begins to crumble, leading Gaston
 to fall to his death. The Beast then dies just as the last petal falls and the servants become inanimate objects themselves shortly
 after the ordeal.
As Belle tearfully professes her love to the Beast, Agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the
 curse which repairs the crumbling castle, revives the Beast and restores him and his servants to their human
 forms and to the villagers' memories once again. The movie ends with the Prince and Belle hosting a ball for the kingdom,
 where they dance happily.

In Santa Cecilia, Mexico, Miguel dreams of becoming a musician, even though his family strictly forbids it.
 His great-great-grandmother Imelda was married to a man who left her and their daughter Coco to pursue a career in music,
 and when he never returned, Imelda banished music from her family's life before starting a shoemaking business.
Miguel now lives with the elderly Coco and their family, including Miguel's parents and his abuelita, who are all shoemakers.
 He secretly idolizes Ernesto de la Cruz, a famous musician who died decades earlier, and teaches himself to play guitar from
 Ernesto's old films. On the Day of the Dead, Miguel accidentally damages the picture frame that holds a photo of Coco with
 her mother on the family ofrenda, discovering that a hidden section of the photograph shows his great-great-grandfather
 holding Ernesto's famous guitar. Concluding that Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather, an inspired Miguel leaves to enter
 a talent show for Day of the Dead despite his family's objections.
Breaking into Ernesto's mausoleum, Miguel takes his guitar to use in the show, but once he strums it,
 he becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza. However, he can interact with his skeletal dead relatives
, who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him back with them, they learn that Imelda cannot visit,
 since Miguel accidentally removed her photo from the ofrenda. Miguel discovers that he is cursed for stealing from the dead,
 and must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise, or he will become one of the dead; to do so, he must receive a blessing
 from a member of his family. Imelda offers Miguel a blessing on the condition he end his dream of becoming a musician, but Miguel
 refuses and resolves to seek Ernesto's blessing instead. He meets Héctor, who declares that he knows Ernesto, offering to help him
 reach him in return for Miguel taking his photo back with him, so that he might visit his daughter before she forgets him, causing
 him to disappear completely. Héctor helps Miguel enter a talent competition to win entry to Ernesto's mansion, but Miguel's family
 tracks him down, forcing him to flee.
Miguel sneaks into the mansion, where Ernesto welcomes him as his descendant,
 but Héctor confronts them, again imploring Miguel to take his photo to the Land of the Living.
 Ernesto and Héctor renew an argument from their partnership in life, and Miguel realizes that when Héctor decided to
 leave the duo to return to his family, Ernesto poisoned him, then stole his guitar along with his songs, passing them off as
 his own to become famous. To protect his legacy, Ernesto seizes the photo and has his security guards throw Miguel and Héctor into a cenote pit.
 There, Miguel realizes that Héctor is his real great-great-grandfather, and that Coco is Héctor's daughter.
After Imelda and the family rescue the duo, Miguel reveals the truth about Héctor's death.
 Imelda and Héctor reconcile, and the family infiltrates Ernesto's concert to retrieve Héctor's photo.
 Ernesto's crimes are exposed to the audience, who jeer at him as he is thrown out of the stadium, then crushed by a giant
 bell in the same manner that he originally died. In the chaos, however, Héctor's photograph is lost. 
As the sun rises, Coco's life and memory are fading; Imelda and Héctor bless Miguel, so that he can return to the Land of the Living.
 After Miguel plays "Remember Me", Coco brightens and sings along with Miguel.
 She reveals that she had saved the torn-off piece of the family photo with Héctor's face on it,
 then tells her family stories about her father, thus saving his memory as well as his existence in the Land of the Dead.
 Miguel's family reconciles with him, ending the ban on music.
One year later, Miguel presents the family ofrenda (which now includes the deceased Coco)
 to his new baby sister Socorro.[15]: 128  Coco's collected letters from Héctor prove that Ernesto stole his songs,
 destroying Ernesto's ill-gotten legacy and allowing Héctor to be rightfully honored in his place. In the Land of the Dead,
 Héctor and Imelda rekindle their romance, joining Coco and the rest of their family for a visit to the living, where Miguel
 in a mariachi costume sings and plays for his relatives, both living and dead.

Aladdin, a street urchin in the Arabian city of Agrabah,
 and his monkey Abu meet Princess Jasmine, who has snuck away from her sheltered life in the palace.
 Jasmine wishes to succeed her father as Sultan, but is instead expected to marry one of her royal suitors,
 including the charming yet dimwitted Prince Anders. Jafar, the grand vizier,
 schemes to overthrow the Sultan and seeks a magic lamp hidden in the Cave of Wonders,
 but only "the diamond in the rough" can enter the cave.
Jafar's pet parrot Iago spots Aladdin and Abu sneaking into the royal palace and visiting Jasmine.
 Aladdin is then captured by Jafar. He offers to make Aladdin rich enough to impress Jasmine in exchange for retrieving the lamp,
 and warns him to take nothing else. Inside the cave, Aladdin frees a magic carpet and finds the lamp,
 but Abu cannot resist touching some treasure and causes the cave to collapse. Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar,
 who double crosses and kicks him and Abu into the cave, but Abu steals the lamp back.
Trapped in the cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unwittingly summoning the omnipotent Genie inside,
 who explains that he has the power to grant Aladdin three wishes. Aladdin gets them out of
 the cave without using a wish on a technicality: he did not rub the lamp in the first place as he stated the wish.
 Determined to woo Jasmine, he uses his official first wish to become a prince, and promises to use his third wish
 to free the Genie from servitude and turn him human.
Aladdin makes an extravagant arrival at Agrabah as Prince Ali of Ababwa,
 but struggles to impress Jasmine. Posing as Aladdin's human attendant, the Genie is mutually smitten with Dalia, Jasmine's handmaiden.
 Aladdin and Jasmine bond when he takes her on a ride on the magic carpet.
 Tricked into revealing his true identity, he lies to her, saying that he actually is a prince and dressed like a peasant to explore Agrabah.
Jafar discovers Aladdin's identity and throws him into the palace moat,
 knowing that if he survives, it will prove he has the lamp. The Genie saves Aladdin, 
costing him his second wish. Aladdin returns to the palace and breaks Jafar's magic cobra staff, ending his spell
 over the Sultan and revealing his plot. Jafar is then arrested and imprisoned in the dungeons.
 The Sultan allows Aladdin to marry Jasmine. Aladdin goes back on his promise to free the Genie, feeling uncertain of being able to keep
 up his persona without him. Dismayed that his master wants to continue living a lie, the Genie retreats to his lamp in disappointment.
Freed by Iago, Jafar steals the lamp and becomes the Genie's new master.
 He uses his first wish to become sultan, but Jasmine reminds the palace guards of their true loyalty,
 turning them against Jafar. Using his second wish to become the world's most powerful sorcerer, Jafar exposes Aladdin,
 exiles him and Abu to a frozen wasteland, imprisons the palace guards and Jasmine's pet tiger Rajah,
 and then threatens to kill the Sultan and Dalia unless Jasmine agrees to marry him. At the wedding,
 Jasmine rescues the lamp from Jafar and jumps into the magic carpet to escape with Aladdin and Abu, who had been rescued
 from the frozen wasteland by the same carpet (The Genie sent it behind Jafar's back). Chased by Iago, whom Jafar briefly
 transformed into a giant, and Jafar using a thunderstorm and sand twister, Aladdin and Jasmine are recaptured and the magic carpet is destroyed.
Aladdin taunts Jafar for being second in power to the Genie, goading him into using his last wish to become
 "the most powerful being in the universe" which the Genie obliges to, transforming Jafar into an even more powerful genie.
 This traps Jafar inside his own lamp, dragging Iago with him, and the Genie banishes them to the Cave of Wonders.
 Abu rescues the magic carpet and Genie fixes it up. Aladdin keeps his promise and uses his last wish to free the Genie,
 allowing him to live as a human. The Sultan crowns Jasmine the new sultana-regnant, no longer bound to marry a prince,
 and she and Aladdin marry. The Genie marries Dalia and they start a family and explore the world together,
 becoming the mariner who is telling his children the story about Aladdin in the beginning of the film.

In the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Harry lives in a cupboard under the stairs in the house of the Dursleys,
 his aunt, uncle and cousin. The Dursleys consider themselves perfectly normal, but at the age of eleven, Harry discovers that he is a wizard.
 He meets a half-giant named Hagrid who invites him to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
 Harry learns that as a baby, his parents were murdered by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort.
 When Voldemort attempted to kill Harry, his curse rebounded and Harry survived with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.
Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts and is sorted into Gryffindor House.
 He gains the friendship of Ron Weasley, a member of a large but poor wizarding family,
 and Hermione Granger, a witch of non-magical, or Muggle, parentage. Harry encounters the school's potions master,
 Severus Snape, who displays a dislike for him; the rich pure-blood Draco Malfoy whom he develops an enmity with;
 and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell, who turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort.
 The first book concludes with Harry's confrontation with Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to gain the power
 of the Philosopher's Stone, a substance that bestows everlasting life.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets describes Harry's second year at Hogwarts.
 Students are attacked and petrified by an unknown creature; wizards of Muggle parentage are the primary targets.
 The attacks appear related to the Chamber of Secrets, a fifty-year-old mystery at the school.
 Harry discovers an ability to speak the snake language Parseltongue, which he learns is rare and associated with the Dark Arts.
 When Hermione is attacked, Harry and Ron uncover the chamber's secrets and enter it.
 Harry discovers that the chamber was opened by Ron's younger sister, Ginny Weasley, who was possessed by an old diary in her belongings.
 The memory of Tom Marvolo Riddle, Voldemort's younger self, resided inside the diary and unleashed the basilisk,
 an ancient monster that kills those who make direct eye contact.
 Harry draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, slays the basilisk and destroys the diary.
In the third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry learns that he is targeted by Sirius Black,
 an escaped convict who allegedly assisted in his parents' murder. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors
 – creatures guarding the school that feed on despair – he reaches out to Remus Lupin,
 a new professor who teaches him the Patronus charm. On a windy night, Ron is dragged by a black dog into the Shrieking Shack;
 Harry and Hermione follow. The dog is revealed to be Sirius Black. Lupin enters the shack and explains that Black was James Potter's
 best friend; he was framed by Peter Pettigrew, who hides as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. As the full moon rises,
 Lupin transforms into a werewolf and bounds away; the group chase after him but are surrounded by dementors.
 They are saved by a mysterious figure who casts a stag Patronus. This is later revealed to be a future version of Harry,
 who traveled back in time with Hermione using the Time Turner. The duo help Sirius escape on a Hippogriff.

Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
 Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy
 #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been featured in movies, television shows,
 video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle
 Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the
 character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters,
 such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson and Harry Osborn, romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson and
 the Black Cat, and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin and Venom. In his origin story, he gets spider
-related abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength
 and agility, and detecting danger with his "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that
 shoot artificial spider webs of his own design.
When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role
 of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens,
 New York, as Spider-Man's secret identity, whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which
 young readers could relate.[9] While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and
 Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman;
 he thus had to learn for himself that "with great power there must also come great responsibility"—a
 line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian,
 his late Uncle Ben Parker.
Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man.
 Over the years, the Peter Parker character developed from a shy, nerdy New York City high school student to troubled but outgoing
 college student, to married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2000s, he joins the Avengers.
 Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following a body swap plot in which Peter appears to die.
 Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of
 Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in an alternate
 universe; and Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, which depicts the teenager Miles Morales, who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate
 Peter Parker's supposed death. Miles later became a popular superhero in his own right, and was brought into the mainstream continuity,
 where he sometimes works alongside Peter.
Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes.
 He has appeared in countless forms of media, including several animated TV series,
 a live action television series, syndicated newspaper comic strips, and in multiple series of films.
 The character was first portrayed in live action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories, a The Electric Company skit
 which ran from 1974 to 1977.[12] In films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield,
 and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Tom Holland. He was voiced by Chris Pine and Jake Johnson in the animated film Spider-Man:
 Into the Spider-Verse. Reeve Carney starred originally as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.
 Spider-Man has been well received as a superhero and comic book character, and he is often ranked as one of the most popular and iconic
 comic book characters of all time and one of the most popular characters in all fiction.

Marvel Entertainment, LLC (formerly Marvel Enterprises) is an American entertainment company founded in June 1998 and based in New York City,
 New York, formed by the merger of Marvel Entertainment Group and ToyBiz.
 The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, and is mainly known for its comic books by Marvel Comics,
 as well as its forays into films, including those within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).
In 2009, The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment for US$4 billion; it has been a limited liability
 company (LLC) since then. For financial reporting purposes, Marvel is primarily reported as part of Disney's Consumer Products
 segment ever since Marvel Studios' reorganization from Marvel Entertainment into Walt Disney Studios.
Over the years, Marvel Entertainment has entered into several partnerships and negotiations with other companies across
 a variety of businesses. As of 2019, Marvel has film licensing agreements with Sony Pictures (for Spider-Man films) and
 Universal Pictures (a right of first refusal to pick up the distribution rights to any future Hulk films produced by Marvel Studios),
 and theme park licensing agreements with IMG Worlds of Adventure and Universal Parks & Resorts (for specific Marvel character rights at
 Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios Japan). Aside from their contract with Universal Parks & Resorts, Marvel's
 characters and properties have also appeared at Disney Parks.

Washington, D.C., formally the District of Columbia, also known as just Washington or
 just D.C., is the capital city and only federal district of the United States. It is located on the east bank of the Potomac
 River, which forms its southwestern and southern border with the U.S. state of Virginia, and shares a land border with the U.S.
 state of Maryland on its remaining sides. The city was named for George Washington, a Founding Father and the first president of
 the United States, and the federal district is named after Columbia, a female personification of the nation. As the seat of the
 U.S. federal government and several international organizations, the city is an important world political capital.
 It is one of the most visited cities in the U.S., seeing over 20 million visitors in 2016.
The U.S. Constitution provides for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress;
 the district is therefore not a part of any U.S. state (nor is it one itself). 
The signing of the Residence Act on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River near 
the country's East Coast. The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the national capital, and Congress held its
 first session there in 1800. In 1801, the territory, formerly part of Maryland and Virginia
 (including the settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria), officially became recognized as the federal district.
 In 1846, Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia, including the city of Alexandria;
 in 1871, it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the district.
 There have been efforts to make the city into a state since the 1880s, a movement that has gained momentum in recent years,
 and a statehood bill passed the House of Representatives in 2021.
The city is divided into quadrants centered on the Capitol Building, and there are as many as 131 neighborhoods.
 According to the 2020 Census, it has a population of 689,545,] which makes it the 20th-most populous city in the U.S.,
 third-most populous city in both the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, and gives it a population larger than that of two U.S. states:
 Wyoming and Vermont. Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more
 than one million during the workweek. Washington's metropolitan area, the country's sixth-largest (including parts of Maryland,
 Virginia and West Virginia), had a 2019 estimated population of 6.3 million residents.
The three branches of the U.S. federal government are centered in the district: Congress (legislative),
 the president (executive), and the Supreme Court (judicial). Washington is home to many national monuments and museums,
 primarily situated on or around the National Mall. The city hosts 177 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of
 many international organizations, trade unions, non-profits, lobbying groups, and professional associations, including
 the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, the AARP, the National Geographic Society,
 the Human Rights Campaign, the International Finance Corporation, and the American Red Cross.
A locally elected mayor and a 13-member council have governed the district since 1973. Congress maintains supreme authority
 over the city and may overturn local laws. D.C. residents elect a non-voting, at-large congressional delegate to the House
 of Representatives, but the district has no representation in the Senate. District voters choose three presidential electors
 in accordance with the Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1961.

Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
 While large amounts of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water.
 About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes and rivers.
 The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands.
 Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges,
 volcanoes and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere,
 deflecting destructive solar winds.
Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen.
 More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation.
 Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the planet.
 Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO2) trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface.
 A region's climate is governed by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans. 
Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.
Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System.
 Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light minutes away from the Sun and orbits it,
 taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in a day.
 Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane with the Sun, producing seasons.
 Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 380,000 km (1.3 light seconds)
 and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon always faces the Earth with the same side through tidal locking and causes tides,
 stabilizes Earth's axis and gradually slows its rotation.
Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. During the first billion years of Earth's history,
 the ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface,
 leading to Earth's Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago, and have reached a population of
 almost 8 billion today. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly impacted 
Earth's environment. Today, humanity's impact on Earth's climate, soils, waters and ecosystems is unsustainable,
 threatening people's lives and causing widespread extinction of other life.

The universe is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy.
 The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the universe.
 According to this theory, space and time emerged together  billion years ago, and the universe has been expanding ever since.
 While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown, the cosmic inflation equation indicates that it must have a minimum diameter
 of 23 trillion light years, and it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe, which is approximately 93
 billion light-years in diameter at the present day.
The earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric,
 placing Earth at the center. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop
 the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation,
 Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe.
Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way,
 which is one of a few hundred billion galaxies in the universe. Many of the stars in a galaxy have planets.
 At the largest scale, galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the universe has 
neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments
 and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the universe
 had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then at an increasing rate.
According to the Big Bang theory, the energy and matter initially present have become less dense as the universe expanded.
 After an initial accelerated expansion called the inflationary epoch at around 10−32 seconds,
 and the separation of the four known fundamental forces, the universe gradually cooled and continued to expand,
 allowing the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form. Dark matter gradually gathered,
 forming a foam-like structure of filaments and voids under the influence of gravity.
 Giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense,
 forming the first galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today.

A planet is a large astronomical body that is neither a star nor a stellar remnant.
 There are competing scientific definitions of a "planet". In the dynamicist definition
 adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a planet is a non-stellar body that
 is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, that directly orbits a star, and that has
 cleared its orbital zone of competing objects. The IAU has also declared that there are eight planets
 in the Solar System, independently of the formal definition. In the geological definition used by most planetologists,
 a planet is a rounded sub-stellar body, possibly a satellite. In addition to the eight Solar planets accepted by the IAU,
 these include dwarf planets such as Eris and Pluto and planetary-mass moons. Bodies meeting the geological definition are sometimes called
 "planetary-mass objects" or "planemos" for short.
The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology and religion.
 Apart from the Moon, five planets are visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
 Planets were regarded by many early cultures as emissaries of deities or as divine themselves.
 As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, and the invention of the telescope
 enabled the discovery of additional planetary objects that were diverse in size, shape and orbit.
 In 2006, the IAU adopted a resolution limiting the number of planets within the Solar System, though they are not followed by
 all astronomers, especially planetologists. The IAU resolution is controversial because it excludes many geologically active
 planetary-mass objects due to where or what they orbit.
Ptolemy thought that the planets orbited Earth in deferent and epicycle motions.
 Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested before,
 it wasn't until the 17th century that this view was supported by the concrete evidence, in the form of telescopic observations
 performed by Galileo Galilei. About the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observational data collected by Tycho Brahe,
 Johannes Kepler discovered that the planets' orbits were elliptical rather than circular. As observational tools improved, astronomers
 saw that, like Earth, each of the planets rotated around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole, and that some shared such
 features as ice caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observations by space probes have found that Earth and other
 planets share additional characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics and even hydrology.
The eight Solar planets in the IAU definition are divided into two divergent types:
 large low-density giant planets and small rocky terrestrial planets. In order of increasing distance from the Sun,
 they are the four terrestrials: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars; and the four giants: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
 Six are orbited by natural satellites, the two exceptions being the innermost planets Mercury and Venus.
 Under geophysical definitions, the classification is more complex: the Moon and Jupiter's moons Io and Europa
 are additional terrestrial planets, but a large number of small icy planets are also added,
 such as the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto and the other large giant-planet moons such as Ganymede, Callisto, and Titan.
Beginning at the end of the twentieth century, several thousand planets have been discovered orbiting other stars.
 These are referred to as "extrasolar planets", or "exoplanets" for short. As of 2 March 2022, 4,980 extrasolar planets
 have been discovered in 3,670 planetary systems. The count includes 813 multi-planetary systems.
 Known exoplanets range in size from gas giants about twice as large as Jupiter down to just over the size of the Moon.
 More than 100 of these planets are approximately the same size as Earth, nine of which orbit in the habitable zone of their star.
 In 2011, the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets orbiting a Sun-like star,
 Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f. A 2012 study, analyzing gravitational microlensing data, estimates a minimum of 1.6
 bound planets on average for every star in the Milky Way. As of 2013, one in five Sun-like stars is thought to have an Earth-sized
 planet in its habitable[e] zone.

A star is an astronomical object comprising a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its gravity.
 The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night,
 but their immense distance from Earth makes them appear as fixed points of light in the sky.
 The most prominent stars have been categorised into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names.
 Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations.
 The observable universe contains an estimated 1022 to 1024 stars.
 Still, most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all individual stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way.
A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen,
 along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. The total mass is the main factor determining its evolution and eventual fate.
 A star shines for most of its active life due to the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core.
 This process releases energy that traverses the star's interior, radiating into outer space.
 At the end of a star's lifetime, its core becomes a stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or—if it is sufficiently massive—a
 black hole.
Stellar nucleosynthesis in stars or their remnants creates almost all naturally occurring chemical elements heavier than lithium.
 Stellar mass loss or supernova explosions return chemically enriched material to the interstellar medium. 
They are then recycled into new stars. Astronomers can determine stellar properties—including mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition),
 variability, distance, and motion through space—by carrying out observations of a star's apparent brightness, spectrum, and changes
 in its position in the sky over time.
Stars can form orbital systems with other astronomical objects,
 as in the case of planetary systems and star systems with two or more stars.
 When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can significantly impact their evolution.
 Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.

A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways,
 carrying goods or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research, and fishing.
 Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity, and purpose.
 In the Age of Sail a "ship" was a sailing vessel defined by its sail plan of at least three square rigged masts and a full bowsprit.
Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization, imperialism, and science.
 After the 15th century, new crops that had come from and to the Americas via the European seafarers
 significantly contributed to the world population growth. Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.
As of 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion dead weight tons.
 Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships.

In biology, an organism (from Ancient Greek ὄργανον (órganon) 'instrument, implement, tool', and is any organic,
 living system that functions as an individual entity. All organisms are composed of cells (cell theory).
 Organisms are classified by taxonomy into groups such as multicellular animals, plants, and fungi; or unicellular microorganisms such
 as protists, bacteria, and archaea. All types of organisms are capable of reproduction, growth and development, maintenance,
 and some degree of response to stimuli. Beetles, squids, tetrapods, mushrooms, and vascular plants are examples of multicellular
 organisms that differentiate specialized tissues and organs during development.
A unicellular organism may be either a prokaryote or a eukaryote.
 Prokaryotes are represented by two separate domains – bacteria and archaea. Eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence
 of a membrane-bound cell nucleus and contain additional membrane-bound compartments called organelles
 (such as mitochondria in animals and plants and plastids in plants and algae, all generally considered to be
 derived from endosymbiotic bacteria). Fungi, animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms within the eukaryotes.
Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 2 million to 1 trillion,
 of which over 1.7 million have been documented. More than 99% of all species, amounting to over five billion species,
 that ever lived are estimated to be extinct.
In 2016, a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms was identified.

Humans are the most abundant and widespread species of primate,
 characterized by bipedalism and large, complex brains. This has enabled the development of advanced tools, culture, and language.
 Humans are highly social and tend to live in complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups,
 from families and kinship networks to political states. Social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values,
 social norms, and rituals, which bolster human society. Curiosity and the human desire to understand and influence the environment
 and to explain and manipulate phenomena have motivated humanity's development of science, philosophy, mythology, religion,
 and other fields of study.
Although some scientists equate the term humans with all members of the genus Homo,
 in common usage it generally refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant member.
 Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis and migrating out of Africa
, gradually replacing local populations of archaic humans. For most of history, all humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers.
 The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago
 (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement.
 As populations became larger and denser, forms of governance developed within and between communities and a number of
 civilizations have risen and fallen. Humans have continued to expand, with a global population of over 7.9 billion as of March 2022.
Genes and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility,
 mental abilities, body size and life span. Though humans vary in many traits (such as genetic predispositions and physical features),
 any two humans are at least 99% genetically similar. Humans are sexually dimorphic: Generally,
 men have greater body strength and women have a higher body fat percentage.
 At puberty, humans develop secondary sex characteristics. Women are capable of pregnancy, and undergo menopause and 
become infertile at around the age of 50.
Humans are omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material,
 and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food since the time of H. erectus.
 They can survive for up to eight weeks without food, and three or four days without water. Humans are generally diurnal,
 sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day. Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death.
 Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth.
Humans have a large and highly developed prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition.
 They are intelligent, capable of episodic memory, have flexible facial expressions, self-awareness and a theory of mind.
 The human mind is capable of introspection, private thought, imagination, volition and forming views on existence.
 This has allowed great technological advancements and complex tool development possible through reason and the transmission
 of knowledge to future generations. Language, art and trade are defining characteristics of humans.
 Long-distance trade routes might have led to cultural explosions and resource distribution that gave humans an
 advantage over other similar species.

Animals (also called Metazoa) are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia.
 With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually,
 and go through an ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula,
 during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million
 are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from
 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments,
 forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.
Most living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan.
 The Bilateria include the protostomes, containing invertebrates such as nematodes, arthropods, and molluscs, and the deuterostomes,
 containing the echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the vertebrates.
 Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian.
 Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion,
 which began around 542 million years ago. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified;
 these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.
Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without.
 Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758
 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809.
 In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous for Animalia)
 and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological classification of 
animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary
 relationships between taxa.
Humans make use of many animal species, such as for food (including meat, milk, and eggs), for materials (such as leather and wool),
 as pets, and as working animals including for transport. Dogs have been used in hunting, as have birds of prey,
 while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports.
 Nonhuman animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.

Plants are predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.
 Historically, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals,
 and included algae and fungi; however, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae,
 as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria). By one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae
 (Latin name for "green plants"), a group that includes the flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their allies,
 hornworts, liverworts, mosses, and the green algae, but excludes the red and brown algae.
Most plants are multicellular organisms. Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by
 primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria. 
Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color.
 Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll
 or to photosynthesize, but still have flowers, fruits, and seeds.
 Plants are characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations, although asexual reproduction is also common.
There are about 320,000 species of plants, of which the great majority, some 260–290 thousand, produce seeds.
 Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen,
 and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems. Plants that produce grain, fruit, and vegetables also form basic human foods
 and have been domesticated for millennia. Plants have many cultural and other uses, as ornaments, building materials, writing material and,
 in great variety, they have been the source of medicines and psychoactive drugs.
 The scientific study of plants is known as botany, a branch of biology.

Bacteria are ubiquitous, mostly free-living organisms often consisting of one biological cell.
 They constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length,
 bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats.
 Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep biosphere of Earth's crust.
 Bacteria are vital in many stages of the nutrient cycle by recycling nutrients such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere.
 The nutrient cycle includes the decomposition of dead bodies; bacteria are responsible for the putrefaction stage in this process.
 In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, extremophile bacteria provide the nutrients needed to
 sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide and methane, to energy.
 Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals.
 Most bacteria have not been characterised and there are many species that cannot be grown in the laboratory.
 The study of bacteria is known as bacteriology, a branch of microbiology.
Humans and most other animals carry millions of bacteria.
 Most are in the gut, and there are many on the skin. Most of the bacteria in and
 on the body are harmless or rendered so by the protective effects of the immune system,
 though many are beneficial, particularly the ones in the gut. However, several species
 of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, tuberculosis,
 tetanus and bubonic plague. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections.
 Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance
 a growing problem. Bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills,
 the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals
 in the mining sector, as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals.
Once regarded as plants constituting the class Schizomycetes, bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes.
 Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes, bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles.
 Although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes, the scientific classification changed after the discovery
 in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved from an ancient common ancestor.
 These evolutionary domains are called Bacteria and Archaea.

Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe.
 "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.
 The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature,
 human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.
The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura,
 or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".
 In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis,
 which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the
 world to develop of their own accord. The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions
 of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word by pre-Socratic philosophers
 (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.
During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality,
 organized and moved by divine laws. With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived
 from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions 
(Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx).
 However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.
Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife.
 Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate
 objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.
 It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things 
that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. 
For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as,
 for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found
 today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been
 brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also
 be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.
`,
    
`
The natural environment or natural world encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally,
 meaning in this case not artificial. The term is most often applied to the Earth or some parts of Earth. 
This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather and natural resources that affect
 human survival and economic activity. The concept of the natural environment can be distinguished as components:
    Complete ecological units that function as natural systems without massive civilized human intervention, including all vegetation,
 microorganisms, soil, rocks, atmosphere, and natural phenomena that occur within their boundaries and their nature.
    Universal natural resources and physical phenomena that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water, and climate, as well as energy,
 radiation, electric charge, and magnetism, not originating from civilized human actions.
In contrast to the natural environment is the built environment.
 Built environments are where humans have fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural land conversion,
 the natural environment is greatly changed into a simplified human environment. Even acts which seem less extreme,
 such as building a mud hut or a photovoltaic system in the desert, the modified environment becomes an artificial one.
 Though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human, hence beaver dams,
 and the works of mound-building termites, are thought of as natural.
People cannot find absolutely natural environments on Earth, and naturalness usually varies in a continuum,
 from 100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. The massive environmental changes of humanity in the Anthropocene have
 fundamentally effected all natural environments: including from climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution from plastic and other
 chemicals in the air and water. More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment, and see that their
 degree of naturalness is not uniform. If, for instance, in an agricultural field, the mineralogic composition and
 the structure of its soil are similar to those of an undisturbed forest soil, but the structure is quite different.

Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals.
 They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, which usually excludes dolphins and porpoises.
 Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates.
 Their closest non-cetacean living relatives are the hippopotamuses, from which they and other cetaceans diverged 
about 54 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti),
 are thought to have had their last common ancestor around 34 million years ago. Whales consist of eight extant families:
 Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae
 (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale),
 and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).
Whales are fully aquatic, open-ocean creatures: they can feed, mate, give birth,
 suckle and raise their young at sea. Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to
 the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest known creature that has ever lived. 
The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several whale species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are
 larger than males.
Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, fringe-like structures that enable them to expel the huge mouthfuls
 of water they take in, while retaining the krill and plankton they feed on.
 Because their heads are enormous—making up as much as 40% of their total body mass—and they have throat pleats that enable
 then to expand their mouths, they are able to take huge quantities of water into their mouth at a time.
 Baleen whales also have a well developed sense of smell.
Toothed whales, in contrast, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid.
 They also have such keen hearing—whether above or below the surface of the water—that some can survive even if they are blind.
 Some species, such as sperm whales, are particularly well adapted for diving to great depths to catch squid and other favoured prey.
Whales evolved from land-living mammals, and must regularly surface to breathe air, although they can remain under
 water for long periods of time. Some species, such as the sperm whale can stay underwater for up to 90 minutes
 They have blowholes (modified nostrils) located on top of their heads, through which air is taken in and expelled.
 They are warm-blooded, and have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin. With streamlined fusiform bodies and two limbs
 that are modified into flippers, whales can travel at speeds of up to 20 knots, though they are not as flexible or agile as seals.
 Whales produce a great variety of vocalizations, notably the extended songs of the humpback whale. Although whales are widespread,
 most species prefer the colder waters of the northern and southern hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth. 
Species such as humpbacks and blue whales are capable of travelling thousands of miles without feeding.
 Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years.
 Calves are typically born in the spring and summer; females bear all the responsibility for raising them.
 Mothers in some species fast and nurse their young for one to two years.
Once relentlessly hunted for their products, whales are now protected by international law.
 The North Atlantic right whales nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a population low of 450,
 and the North Pacific grey whale population is ranked Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Besides the threat from whalers,
 they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. The meat, blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by
 indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Whales have been depicted in various cultures worldwide,
 notably by the Inuit and the coastal peoples of Vietnam and Ghana, who sometimes hold whale funerals.
 Whales occasionally feature in literature and film. A famous example is the great white whale in Herman Melville's novel Moby Dick.
 Small whales, such as belugas, are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks, but breeding success has been poor and
 the animals often die within a few months of capture. Whale watching has become a form of tourism around the world.

A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants
 (plants of the division Angiospermae). The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing
 a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different
 individuals in a population) resulting from cross-pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower)
 when self-pollination occurs.
The two types of pollination are: self-pollination and cross-pollination.
 Self-pollination happens when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant.
 Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of
 the same species. Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so
 that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar
 and pollen as food for pollinators
Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy).
 Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop.
 Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen.
 After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.
In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by
 humans to bring beauty to their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, esotericism, witchcraft,
 religion, medicine, and as a source of food.

Color or colour is the visual perceptual property deriving from the spectrum of light interacting with the photoreceptor cells of the eyes.
 Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects or materials based on their physical properties such as
 light absorption, reflection, or emission spectra. By defining a color space colors can be identified numerically by their coordinates.
Because perception of color stems from the varying spectral sensitivity of different types of cone cells in the retina to different
 parts of the spectrum, colors may be defined and quantified by the degree to which they stimulate these cells.
 These physical or physiological quantifications of color, however, do not fully explain the psychophysical perception of color appearance.
The science of color is sometimes called chromatics, colorimetry, or simply color science.
 It includes the perception of color by the human eye and brain, the origin of color in materials,
 color theory in art, and the physics of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range
 (that is, what is commonly referred to simply as light).

The lion is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India.
 It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.
 It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. 
It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.
 Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates.
 The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans,
 the species typically does not.
The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted,
 it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa, Southeast Europe,
 the Caucasus, and Western and South Asia, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population
 in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined
 by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas.
 Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings,
 on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and
 have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions
 of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's
 historic and current range.

Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws,
 the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.
 Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) ostrich.
 There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. 
Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds.
 Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds,
 including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely 
adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.
Birds are feathered theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs.
 Likewise, birds are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the crocodilians.
 Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose members include Archaeopteryx) which first appeared about 160 million years ago (mya)
 in China. According to DNA evidence, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in the Middle to Late Cretaceous,
 and diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 mya,
 which killed off the pterosaurs and all non-avian dinosaurs.
Many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture.
 Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as
 cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators.
 The vast majority of bird species are socially (but not necessarily sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, 
sometimes for years, and rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous
 (one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males).
 Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction.
 They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.
Many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing,
 with domesticated and undomesticated birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots,
 and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure throughout human culture.
 About 120 to 130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then.
 Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them.
 Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.

Water (chemical formula H2O) is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance,
 which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent).
 It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients.
 Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds.
 The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°.
 "Water" is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard conditions for temperature and pressure.
A number of natural states of water exist. It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog.
 Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state. When finely divided,
 crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor.
Water covers about 70.9% of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans.
 Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%),
 and in the air as vapor, clouds (consisting of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation (0.001%).
 Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation,
 and runoff, usually reaching the sea.
Water plays an important role in the world economy. Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture.
 Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the world.
 Much of the long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil, natural gas, and manufactured products) is transported by
 boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals. Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating,
 in industry and homes. Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of substances both mineral and organic;
 as such it is widely used in industrial processes, and in cooking and washing. Water, ice and snow are also central to many
 sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, diving, ice skating and skiing.

Wind is the natural movement of air or other gases relative to a planet's surface.
 Winds occur on a range of scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes,
 to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to
 global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the
 climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are
 the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet.
 Within the tropics and subtropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can
 drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local
 winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can prevail.
Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed and direction,
 the forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect.
 Winds have various aspects: velocity (wind speed); the density of the gas involved;
 energy content or wind energy. The wind is also a critical means of transportation for
 seeds, insects, and birds, which can travel on wind currents for thousands of miles.
 In meteorology, winds are often referred to according to their strength, and the direction from
 which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of
 intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various
 names associated with their average strength, such as breeze, gale, storm, and hurricane.
 In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space,
 while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space.
 The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn.
In human civilization, the concept of wind has been explored in mythology,
 influenced the events of history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a power source for
 mechanical work, electricity, and recreation. Wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across Earth's oceans.
 Hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel
 consumption. Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft.
 When winds become strong, trees and human-made structures can be damaged or destroyed.
Winds can shape landforms, via a variety of aeolian processes such as the formation of fertile soils,
 for example loess, and by erosion. Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source
 region by the prevailing winds; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust
 outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant
 effects on those regions. Wind also affects the spread of wildfires. Winds can disperse seeds from various
 plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations.
 When combined with cold temperatures, the wind has a negative impact on livestock. Wind affects animals'
 food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.

Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material (the fuel) in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat,
 light, and various reaction products. Fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular
 oxygen, O2, to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy
 (418 kJ per 32 g of O2); the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here.
 At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced.
 The flame is the visible portion of the fire. Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water
 vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma.
 Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.
Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration, which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning.
 Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe.
 The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems.
 Its negative effects include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination.
 If fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water.
 Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements
 such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil.
 This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, but
 this fecundity can potentially be recovered as molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere is "fixed" and converted to 
ammonia by natural phenomena such as lightning and by leguminous plants that are "nitrogen-fixing" such as clover, peas, and green beans.
Fire has been used by humans in rituals, in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light,
 for signaling, propulsion purposes, smelting, forging, incineration of waste, cremation, and as a weapon or mode of destruction.

Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge.
 Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell's equations.
 Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges
 and many others.
The presence of an electric charge, which can be either positive or negative,
 produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field.
When a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it.
 The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. If the charge moves, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge.
 Thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying
 a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.
Electricity is at the heart of many modern technologies, being used for:
    Electric power where electric current is used to energise equipment;
    Electronics which deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors,
 diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies.
Electrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the
 seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The theory of electromagnetism was developed in the 19th century, and by the end 
of that century electricity was being put to industrial and residential use by electrical engineers. 
The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a
 driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it
 can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation.
 Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.

A disaster is a serious problem occurring over a short or long period of time that causes widespread human, material,
 economic or environmental loss which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.
 Developing countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits – more than 95%
 of all deaths caused by hazards occur in developing countries, 
and losses due to natural hazards are 20 times greater (as a percentage of GDP) in developing countries than in industrialized countries.

An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of the surface of the
 Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves.
 Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent
 enough to propel objects and people into the air, and wreak destruction across entire cities.
 The seismicity, or seismic activity, of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time period.
 The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling.
At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or 
disrupting the ground. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore,
 the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can also trigger landslides and,
 occasionally, volcanic activity.
In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event—whether natural or caused by
 humans—that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults but also by other
 events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear tests. An earthquake's point of initial rupture
 is called its hypocenter or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.

In meteorology, a cyclone is a large air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure,
 counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere as viewed from above
 (opposite to an anticyclone). Cyclones are characterized by inward-spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure.
 The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the synoptic scale).
 Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale.
 Mesocyclones, tornadoes, and dust devils lie within smaller mesoscale.
 Upper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low, and can pinch off from the base of the tropical
 upper tropospheric trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets,
 such as Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune. Cyclogenesis is the process of cyclone formation and intensification.
 Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones.
 These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. 
Later in their life cycle, extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems.
 A cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream.
Weather fronts mark the boundary between two masses of air of different temperature, humidity, and densities,
 and are associated with the most prominent meteorological phenomena. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of
 thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Such fronts form west of the circulation
 center and generally move from west to east; warm fronts form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by stratiform
 precipitation and fog. Warm fronts move poleward ahead of the cyclone path. Occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life
 cycle near the center of the cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.
Tropical cyclogenesis describes the process of development of tropical cyclones.
 Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and are warm core.
 Cyclones can transition between extratropical, subtropical, and tropical phases. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land,
 and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments
 of high instability and low vertical wind shear. In the Atlantic and the northeastern Pacific oceans,
 a tropical cyclone is generally referred to as a hurricane (from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind, Huracan),
 in the Indian and south Pacific oceans it is called a cyclone, and in the northwestern Pacific it is called a typhoon.
 The growth of instability in the vortices is not universal. For example, the size, intensity, moist-convection, surface evaporation,
 the value of potential temperature at each potential height can affect the nonlinear evolution of a vortex.

A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or,
 in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. It is often referred to as a twister, whirlwind or cyclone,
 although the word cyclone is used in meteorology to name a weather system with a low-pressure area in the center around which,
 from an observer looking down toward the surface of the earth, winds blow counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise
 in the Southern. Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, and they are often visible in the form of a condensation funnel
 originating from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud, with a cloud of rotating debris and dust beneath it.
 Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour (180 km/h), are about 250 feet (80 m) across,
 and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of
 more than 300 miles per hour (480 km/h), are more than two miles (3 km) in diameter, and stay on the ground for dozens 
of miles (more than 100 km).
Various types of tornadoes include the multiple vortex tornado, landspout, and waterspout.
 Waterspouts are characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud.
 They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over
 whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator
 and are less common at high latitudes. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirl,
 and steam devil.
Tornadoes occur most frequently in North America (particularly in central and southeastern regions of the United States colloquially
 known as tornado alley; the US and Canada have by far the most tornadoes of any countries in the world).
 Tornados also occur in South Africa, much of Europe (except Spain, most of the Alps, Balkans, and northern Scandinavia),
 western and eastern Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh and adjacent eastern India, Japan, Philippines, and southeastern South America
 (Uruguay and Argentina). Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of pulse-Doppler radar by recognizing
 patterns in velocity and reflectivity data, such as hook echoes or debris balls, as well as through the efforts of storm spotters.

A tsunami from Japanese is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water,
 generally in an ocean or a large lake. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions
 (including detonations, landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances) above or 
below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami. Unlike normal ocean waves, which are generated by wind,
 or tides, which are generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun, a tsunami is generated by
 the displacement of water by a large event.
Tsunami waves do not resemble normal undersea currents or sea waves because their wavelength is far longer.
 Rather than appearing as a breaking wave, a tsunami may instead initially resemble a rapidly rising tide.
 For this reason, it is often referred to as a tidal wave, although this usage is not favoured by the scientific
 community because it might give the false impression of a causal relationship between tides and tsunamis.
 Tsunamis generally consist of a series of waves, with periods ranging from minutes to hours, arriving in a so-called "wave train".
 Wave heights of tens of metres can be generated by large events. Although the impact of tsunamis is limited to coastal areas, their
 destructive power can be enormous, and they can affect entire ocean basins. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was among the deadliest
 natural disasters in human history, with at least 230,000 people killed or missing in 14 countries bordering the Indian Ocean.
The Ancient Greek historian Thucydides suggested in his 5th century BC History of the Peloponnesian War that tsunamis were related
 to submarine earthquakes,[12][13] but the understanding of tsunamis remained slim until the 20th century, and much remains unknown.
 Major areas of current research include determining why some large earthquakes do not generate tsunamis while other smaller ones do.
 This ongoing research is designed to help accurately forecast the passage of tsunamis across oceans as well as how tsunami waves interact
 with shorelines.

A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry.
 In the sense of "flowing water", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide.
 Floods are an area of study of the discipline hydrology and are of significant concern in agriculture,
 civil engineering and public health. Human changes to the environment often increase the intensity and frequency of flooding,
 for example land use changes such as deforestation and removal of wetlands, changes in waterway course or flood controls such as
 with levees, and larger environmental issues such as climate change and sea level rise.
 In particular climate change's increased rainfall and extreme weather events increases the severity of other causes for
 flooding, resulting in more intense floods and increased flood risk.
Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean, in which the water overtops
 or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries,
 or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood.
 While the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt,
 these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood property or drown domestic animals.
Floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel,
 particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway. Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses 
if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers. While riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving
 away from rivers and other bodies of water, people have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land
 is usually flat and fertile and because rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry.
 Flooding can lead to secondary consequences in addition to damage to property, such as long-term displacement
 of residents and creating increased spread of waterborne diseases and vector-bourne disesases transmitted by mosquitos.

A disease is an abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function
 of all or part of an organism, and that is not immediately due to any external injury.
 Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific signs and symptoms.
 A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions.
 For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases,
 including various forms of immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity, allergies and autoimmune disorders.
In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction,
 distress, social problems, or death to the person afflicted, or similar problems for those in contact with the person.
 In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms,
 deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be
 considered distinguishable categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living
 with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life.
Death due to disease is called death by natural causes. There are four main types of disease: 
infectious diseases, deficiency diseases, hereditary diseases (including both genetic diseases and non-genetic hereditary diseases),
 and physiological diseases. Diseases can also be classified in other ways, such as communicable versus non-communicable diseases.
 The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease (blood flow obstruction), followed by cerebrovascular 
disease and lower respiratory infections. In developed countries, the diseases that cause the most sickness overall
 are neuropsychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety.
The study of disease is called pathology, which includes the study of etiology, or cause.

Medicine is the science and practice of caring for a patient, managing the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, treatment,
 palliation of their injury or disease, and promoting their health. Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved
 to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences,
 biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through 
pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices
, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.
Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times, during most of which it was an art
 (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture.
 For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply
 bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has
 become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique
 for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being
 stitched arises through science.
Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine or folk medicine, 
which remains commonly used in the absence of scientific medicine, and are thus called alternative medicine.
 Alternative treatments outside of scientific medicine having safety and efficacy concerns are termed quackery.

An astronaut, meaning 'star', and ναύτης (nautes), meaning 'sailor') is a person trained, equipped, 
and deployed by a human spaceflight program to serve as a commander or crew member aboard a spacecraft.
 Although generally reserved for professional space travelers, the term is sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space,
 including scientists, politicians, journalists, and tourists.
"Astronaut" technically applies to all human space travelers regardless of nationality or allegiance; however,
 astronauts fielded by Russia or the Soviet Union are typically known instead as cosmonauts
 (from the Russian "kosmos" (космос), meaning "space", also borrowed from Greek) in order to distinguish them
 from American or otherwise NATO-oriented space travellers. Comparatively recent developments in crewed spaceflight
 made by China have led to the rise of the term taikonaut, although its use is somewhat informal and its origin is unclear.
Since 1961, 600 astronauts have flown in space. Until 2002, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments,
 either by the military or by civilian space agencies. With the suborbital flight of the privately funded SpaceShipOne in 2004,
 a new category of astronaut was created: the commercial astronaut.

The workforce or labour force is the labour pool either in employment or in unemployment.
 It is generally used to describe those working for a single company or industry, but can also apply to a geographic
 region like a city, state, or country. Within a company, its value can be labelled as its "Workforce in Place".
 The workforce of a country includes both the employed and the unemployed (labour force).
 The labour force participation rate, LFPR (or economic activity rate, EAR), is the ratio between the labour force and the overall
 size of their cohort (national population of the same age range).
 The term generally excludes the employers or management, and can imply those involved in manual labour.
 It may also mean all those who are available for work.

A chemical substance is a form of matter having constant chemical composition and characteristic properties.
 Some references add that chemical substance cannot be separated into its constituent elements by physical separation
 methods, i.e., without breaking chemical bonds. Chemical substances can be simple substances,
 chemical compounds, or alloys. Chemical elements may or may not be included in the definition,
 depending on expert viewpoint.
Chemical substances are often called 'pure' to set them apart from mixtures.
 A common example of a chemical substance is pure water; it has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether
 it is isolated from a river or made in a laboratory. Other chemical substances commonly encountered in pure form are diamond (carbon),
 gold, table salt (sodium chloride) and refined sugar (sucrose). However, in practice, no substance is entirely pure,
 and chemical purity is specified according to the intended use of the chemical.
Chemical substances exist as solids, liquids, gases, or plasma, and may change between these phases of matter
 with changes in temperature or pressure and time. Chemical substances may be combined or converted to others by means of chemical reactions.

Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating
 (e.g., Stools, Chairs, and sofas), eating (tables), storing items, eating and/or working with an item, and sleeping
 (e.g., beds and hammocks). Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above
 the ground, such as tables and desks), or to store things (e.g., cupboards, shelves, and drawers). Furniture can be a product of
 design and can be considered a form of decorative art. In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious
 purpose. It can be made from a vast multitude of materials, including metal, plastic, and wood.
 Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often reflects the local culture.
People have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the
 beginning of human civilization and continues today in some households/campsites. Archaeological research
 shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people started to construct and carve their own furniture, 
using wood, stone, and animal bones. Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a Venus
 figurine found in Russia, depicting the goddess on a throne. The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes
 of Skara Brae in Scotland, and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone. Complex construction techniques such as 
joinery began in the early dynastic period of ancient Egypt. This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including stools and tables, sometimes
 decorated with valuable metals or ivory. The evolution of furniture design continued in ancient Greece and ancient Rome,
 with thrones being commonplace as well as the klinai, multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping.
 The furniture of the Middle Ages was usually heavy, oak, and ornamented. Furniture design expanded during the Italian
 Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe,
 was characterized by opulent, often gilded Baroque designs. The nineteenth century is usually defined by revival styles.
 The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards Modernism. One unique outgrowth of post-modern
 furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.

Fitness is defined as the quality or state of being fit and healthy. Around 1950, perhaps consistent with the Industrial
 Revolution and the treatise of World War II, the term "fitness" increased in western vernacular by a factor of ten.
 The modern definition of fitness describes either a person or machine's ability to perform a specific function or a
 holistic definition of human adaptability to cope with various situations. This has led to an interrelation of human fitness
 and physical attractiveness that has mobilized global fitness and fitness equipment industries. Regarding specific function,
 fitness is attributed to persons who possess significant aerobic or anaerobic ability (i.e., endurance or strength).
 A well-rounded fitness program improves a person in all aspects of fitness compared to practicing only one, such as only 
cardio/respiratory or only weight training.
A comprehensive fitness program tailored to an individual typically focuses on one or more specific skills,
 and on age or health-related needs such as bone health. Many sources also cite mental, social and emotional health as an 
important part of overall fitness. This is often presented in textbooks as a triangle made up of three points, which represent
 physical, emotional, and mental fitness. Physical fitness has been shown to have benefits in preventing ill health and assisting
 recovery from injury or illness. Along with the physical health benefits of fitness, it has also been shown to have a positive impact
 on mental health as well by assisting in treating anxiety and depression. Physical fitness can also prevent or treat many other
 chronic health conditions brought on by unhealthy lifestyle or aging as well and has been listed frequently as one of the most
 popular and advantageous self-care therapies. Working out can also help some people sleep better by building up sleeping pressure
 and possibly alleviate some mood disorders in certain individuals.
Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through
 the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known
 as myokines, which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which
 in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.

`
A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is a covered location for athletics.
 The word is derived from the ancient Greek term "gymnasium". They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centres,
 and as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions. "Gym" is also slang for "fitness centre", which is often an area
 for indoor recreation. A "gym" may include or describe adjacent open air areas as well. In Western countries, "gyms"
 often describe places with indoor or outdoor courts for basketball, hockey, tennis, boxing or wrestling, and with equipment and machines
 used for physical development training, or to do exercises. In many European countries, Gymnasium (and variations of the word)
 also can describe a secondary school that prepares students for higher education at a university, with or without the presence
 of athletic courts, fields, or equipment.

In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after flowering.
Fruits are the means by which flowering plants disseminate their seeds.
 Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is
 the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent
 on fruits as a source of food. Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output,
 and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.
In common language usage, "fruit" normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures (or produce) of plants that typically
 are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries. In botanical
 usage, the term "fruit" also includes many structures that are not commonly called "fruits", such as nuts, bean pods, corn kernels,
 tomatoes, and wheat grains.

`
Massage is the manipulation of the body's soft tissues. Massage techniques are commonly applied with hands,
 fingers, elbows, knees, forearms, feet, or a device. The purpose of massage is generally for the treatment of body stress or pain.
 In European countries, a person professionally trained to give massages is traditionally known as a masseur (male) or masseuse (female).
 In the United States, these individuals are often referred to as massage therapists, because they must be certified and
 licensed as "Licensed Massage Therapists".
In professional settings, clients are treated while lying on a massage table,
 sitting in a massage chair, or lying on a mat on the floor. There are many different modalities in the massage industry,
 including (but not limited to): deep tissue, manual lymphatic drainage, medical, sports, structural integration, Swedish, Thai, and trigger point.

`
The words care, therapy, treatment, and intervention overlap in a semantic field, and thus they can be synonymous depending on context.
 Moving rightward through that order, the connotative level of holism decreases and the level of specificity (to concrete instances) increases.
 Thus, in health care contexts (where its senses are always noncount), the word care tends to imply a broad idea of everything done to protect
 or improve someone's health (for example, as in the terms preventive care and primary care, which connote ongoing action),
 although it sometimes implies a narrower idea (for example, in the simplest cases of wound care or postanesthesia care, a
 few particular steps are sufficient, and the patient's interaction with that provider is soon finished). In contrast, the word intervention
 tends to be specific and concrete, and thus the word is often countable; for example, one instance of cardiac catheterization is one 
intervention performed, and coronary care (noncount) can require a series of interventions (count). At the extreme,
 the piling on of such countable interventions amounts to interventionism, a flawed model of care lacking holistic circumspection—merely 
treating discrete problems (in billable increments) rather than maintaining health. Therapy and treatment, in the middle of the semantic field,
 can connote either the holism of care or the discreteness of intervention, with context conveying the intent in each use. Accordingly,they  
can be used in both noncount and count senses (for example, therapy for chronic kidney disease can involve several dialysis treatments per week).
The words aceology and iamatology are obscure and obsolete synonyms referring to the study of therapies.
The English word therapy comes via Latin therapīa from Greek: θεραπεία and literally means "curing" or "healing".

Cooking, cookery, or culinary arts is the art, science and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption.
 Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, 
to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting local conditions.
Types of cooking also depend on the skill levels and training of the cooks.
 Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments.
Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans. It may have started around 2 million years ago,
 though archaeological evidence for the same does not predate more than 1 million years.
The expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade, and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients.
 New inventions and technologies, such as the invention of pottery for holding and boiling of water, expanded cooking techniques.
 Some modern cooks apply advanced scientific techniques to food preparation to further enhance the flavor of the dish served.

Bathing is the washing of the body with a liquid, usually water or an aqueous solution, or the immersion of the body in water.
 It may be practiced for personal hygiene, religious ritual or therapeutic purposes. By analogy, especially as a recreational activity,
 the term is also applied to sun bathing and sea bathing.
Astronaut Jack Lousma taking a shower in space, 1973
Bathing can take place in any situation where there is water, ranging from warm to cold.
 It can take place in a bathtub or shower, or it can be in a river, lake, water hole, pool, or the sea,
 or any other water receptacle. The term for the act can vary. For example, a ritual religious bath is sometimes referred to
 as immersion or baptism, the use of water for therapeutic purposes can be called a water treatment or hydrotherapy, and two
 recreational water activities are known as swimming and paddling.

Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of horticulture.
 In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers, foliage, or overall appearance; 
useful plants, such as root vegetables, leaf vegetables, fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes,
 or for medicinal or cosmetic use.
Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with one or more different types of shrubs,
 trees, and herbaceous plants, to residential back gardens including lawns and foundation plantings, and to container gardens
 grown inside or outside. Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a variety of plants
 in mixed plantings. It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates
 it from farming or forestry.

A house is a single-unit residential building. It may range in complexity from a rudimentary hut to a complex structure of wood,
 masonry, concrete or other material, outfitted with plumbing, electrical, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems.
 Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space.
 Houses may have doors or locks to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from burglars or other trespassers.
 Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more bedrooms and bathrooms, a kitchen or cooking area, and a living
 room. A house may have a separate dining room, or the eating area may be integrated into another room. Some large houses in North America
 have a recreation room. In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle)
 may share part of the house with humans.
The social unit that lives in a house is known as a household. Most commonly, a household is a family unit of some kind,
 although households may also be other social groups, such as roommates or, in a rooming house, unconnected individuals.
 Some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar-sized group; larger houses called townhouses or row houses may
 contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure. A house may be accompanied by outbuildings, such as a garage for vehicles
 or a shed for gardening equipment and tools. A house may have a backyard or a front yard or both, which serve as additional areas
 where inhabitants can relax or eat.

A villa is a type of house that was originally an ancient Roman upper-class country house.
 Since its origins in the Roman villa, the idea and function of a villa have evolved considerably.
 After the fall of the Roman Republic, villas became small farming compounds, which were increasingly fortified in Late Antiquity,
 sometimes transferred to the Church for reuse as a monastery. Then they gradually re-evolved through the Middle 
Ages into elegant upper-class country homes. In modern parlance, "villa" can refer to various types and sizes of residences,
 ranging from the suburban semi-detached double villa to residences in the wildland–urban interface.

A shopping mall (or simply mall) is a North American term for a large indoor shopping center, usually anchored by department stores.
 The term "mall" originally meant a pedestrian promenade with shops along it (that is, the term was used to refer to the walkway itself
 which was merely bordered by such shops), but in the late 1960s, it began to be used as a generic term for the large enclosed shopping
 centers that were becoming commonplace at the time. In the U.K., such complexes are considered shopping centres
 (Commonwealth English: shopping centre), though "shopping center" covers many more sizes and types of centers than
 the North American "mall". Other countries may follow U.S. usage (India,[3] U.A.E.,[4] etc.) and others (Australia,[5] etc.) follow U.K. usage.
Many malls have declined considerably (especially in the United States and Canada), and some have closed and become so-called "dead malls".
 Successful exceptions have added entertainment and experiential features, added big-box stores as anchors, or converted
 to other specialized shopping center formats such as power centers, lifestyle centers, factory outlet centers, and festival marketplaces.

A building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place,
 such as a house or factory. Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions, and have been adapted throughout history
 for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, land prices, ground conditions,
 specific uses, and aesthetic reasons. To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures.
Buildings serve several societal needs – primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy,
 to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work. A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the human habitat
 (a place of comfort and safety) and the outside (a place that at times may be harsh and harmful).
Ever since the first cave paintings, buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression.
 In recent years, interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process
 of many new buildings and other structures.

A coffeehouse, coffee shop, or café is an establishment that primarily serves coffee of various types, e.g. espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
 Some coffeehouses may serve cold drinks, such as iced coffee, iced tea, and other non-caffeinated beverages.
 In continental Europe, cafés serve alcoholic drinks. A coffeehouse may also serve food, such as light snacks, sandwiches, muffins, fruit,
 or pastries. Coffeehouses range from owner-operated small businesses to large multinational corporations. Some coffeehouse chains operate
 on a franchise business model, with numerous branches across various countries around the world.
While café may refer to a coffeehouse, the term "café" generally refers to a diner, British café (colloquially called a "caff"),
 "greasy spoon" (a small and inexpensive restaurant), transport café, teahouse or tea room, or other casual eating and drinking place.
 A coffeehouse may share some of the same characteristics of a bar or restaurant, but it is different from a cafeteria.
 Many coffeehouses in the Middle East and in West Asian immigrant districts in the Western world offer shisha
 (actually called nargile in Levantine Arabic, Greek and Turkish), flavored tobacco smoked through a hookah.
 An espresso bar is a type of coffeehouse that specializes in serving espresso and espresso-based drinks.
From a cultural standpoint, coffeehouses largely serve as centers of social interaction:
 a coffeehouse provides patrons with a place to congregate, talk, read, write, entertain one another,
 or pass the time, whether individually or in small groups. Since the popularization of Wi-Fi, coffeehouses with this 
capability have also become places for patrons to access the Internet on their laptops and tablet computers. 
A coffeehouse can serve as an informal club for its regular members.[6] As early as the 1950s Beatnik era and the 1960s folk music scene,
 coffeehouses have hosted singer-songwriter performances, typically in the evening.

An amusement park is a park that features various attractions, such as rides and games, as well as other events for entertainment purposes.
 A theme park is a type of amusement park that bases its structures and attractions around a central theme, often featuring multiple areas
 with different themes. Unlike temporary and mobile funfairs and carnivals, amusement parks are stationary and built for long-lasting operation.
 They are more elaborate than city parks and playgrounds, usually providing attractions that cater to a variety of age groups.
 While amusement parks often contain themed areas, theme parks place a heavier focus with more intricately-designed themes that
 revolve around a particular subject or group of subjects.
Amusement parks evolved from European fairs, pleasure gardens, and large picnic areas, which were created for people's recreation.
 World's fairs and other types of international expositions also influenced the emergence of the amusement park industry.
 Lake Compounce opened in 1846 and is considered the oldest, continuously-operating amusement park in North America.
 The first theme parks emerged in the mid-twentieth century with the opening of Santa Claus Land in 1946, Santa's Workshop in 1949,
 and Disneyland in 1955.

A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the cultivation, display, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature.
 The single feature identifying even the wildest wild garden is control. The garden can incorporate both natural and artificial materials.
Gardens often have design features including statuary, follies, pergolas, trellises, stumperies, dry creek beds, and water features such as
 fountains, ponds (with or without fish), waterfalls or creeks. Some gardens are for ornamental purposes only, while others also
 produce food crops, sometimes in separate areas, or sometimes intermixed with the ornamental plants. Food-producing gardens are distinguished
 from farms by their smaller scale, more labor-intensive methods, and their purpose (enjoyment of a hobby or self-sustenance rather than
 producing for sale, as in a market garden). Flower gardens combine plants of different heights, colors, textures, and fragrances
 to create interest and delight the senses.
The most common form today is a residential or public garden, but the term garden has traditionally been a more general one.
 Zoos, which display wild animals in simulated natural habitats, were formerly called zoological gardens.
 Western gardens are almost universally based on plants, with garden, which etymologically implies enclosure, often signifying a shortened
 form of botanical garden. Some traditional types of eastern gardens, such as Zen gardens, however, use plants sparsely or not at all.
 Landscape gardens, on the other hand, such as the English landscape gardens first developed in the 18th century, may omit flowers altogether.
Landscape architecture is a related professional activity with landscape architects tending to engage in design at
 many scales and working on both public and private projects.

A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river.
 In some cases, a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water.
 Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions
 for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size.
 Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are "run" in some parts of the United States, "burn" 
in Scotland and northeast England, and "beck" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek,
 but not always: the language is vague.

Rivers are part of the hydrological cycle. Water generally collects in a river from precipitation through a drainage basin from surface
 runoff and other sources such as groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks
 (e.g., from glaciers).
Rivers and streams are often considered major features within a landscape; however, they actually only cover around 0.1% of the land on Earth.
 They are made more obvious and significant to humans since many human cities and civilizations are built around the freshwater supplied by
 rivers and streams. Most of the major cities of the world are situated on the banks of rivers, as they are,
 or were, used as a source of water, for obtaining food, for transport, as borders, as a defensive measure, as a source
 of hydropower to drive machinery, for bathing, and as a means of disposing of waste. In the preindustrial era larger rivers 
were a major obstruction to the movement of people, goods, and armies across them. Towns often developed at the few locations
 they could be crossed. Many major cities such as London are located at the lowest point at which a river could be bridged.
Potamology is the scientific study of rivers, while limnology is the study of inland waters in general.

A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock.
 A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres
 (1000 feet) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.
Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism, which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years.
 Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass
 wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers.
High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar latitude.
 These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals.
 Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction,
 such as mining and logging, along with recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing.
The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,850 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level.
 The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft).

A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions are hostile for plant and animal
 life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation.
 About one-third of the land surface of the Earth is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions, where little precipitation
 occurs, and which are sometimes called polar deserts or "cold deserts". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls,
 by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.
Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put strains on the rocks,
 which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods.
 Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter, and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor are further eroded
 by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust, which can remain airborne for extended periods – sometimes causing the formation
 of sand storms or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down,
 and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes.
 Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones.
 These areas are known as desert pavements, and little further erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed
 bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate.
 There may be underground sources of water, in the form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found, oases can occur.
Plants and animals living in the desert need special adaptations to survive in the harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry
 with small or no leaves, water-resistant cuticles, and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die in
 the course of a few weeks after rainfall, while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground
 moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal, and stay in the shade or underground
 during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating
 their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again during the rare rainfall.
 They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.
People have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia.
 Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available, and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life.
 The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil and is one of the causes of increased desertification. 
Desert farming is possible with the aid of irrigation, and the Imperial Valley in California provides an example of how previously
 barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source. Many trade routes have been forged across deserts,
 especially across the Sahara, and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. 
Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara. Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts,
 and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of solar energy.

In meteorology, a cloud is an aerosol consisting of a visible mass of minute liquid droplets, frozen crystals,
 or other particles suspended in the atmosphere of a planetary body or similar space.
 Water or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and crystals.
 On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point,
 or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise
 the dew point to the ambient temperature. They are seen in the Earth's homosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere,
 and mesosphere. Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology.
 There are two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the homosphere, Latin and common.
Genus types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth's surface, have Latin names because of the universal adoption
 of Luke Howard's nomenclature that was formally proposed in 1802. It became the basis of a modern international system that divides
 clouds into five physical forms which can be further divided or classified into altitude levels to derive ten basic genera.
 The main representative cloud types for each of these forms are stratiform, cumuliform, stratocumuliform, cumulonimbiform, and cirriform.
 Low-level clouds do not have any altitude-related prefixes. However mid-level stratiform and stratocumuliform types are given the prefix
 alto- while high-level variants of these same two forms carry the prefix cirro-. In both cases, strato- is dropped from the latter
 form to avoid double-prefixing. Genus types with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one level do not carry any altitude
 related prefixes. They are classified formally as low- or mid-level depending on the altitude at which each initially forms, and
 are also more informally characterized as multi-level or vertical. Most of the ten genera derived by this method of classification
 can be subdivided into species and further subdivided into varieties. Very low stratiform clouds that extend down to the Earth's
 surface are given the common names fog and mist, but have no Latin names.
In the stratosphere and mesosphere, clouds have common names for their main types.
 They may have the appearance of stratiform veils or sheets, cirriform wisps, or stratocumuliform bands or ripples.
 They are seen infrequently, mostly in the polar regions of Earth. Clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other planets
 and moons in the Solar System and beyond. However, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are often composed
 of other substances such as methane, ammonia, and sulfuric acid, as well as water.
Tropospheric clouds can have a direct effect on climate change on Earth.
 They may reflect incoming rays from the sun which can contribute to a cooling effect where and when these clouds occur,
 or trap longer wave radiation that reflects back up from the Earth's surface which can cause a warming effect.
 The altitude, form, and thickness of the clouds are the main factors that affect the local heating or cooling of Earth and the atmosphere.
 Clouds that form above the troposphere are too scarce and too thin to have any influence on climate change. Clouds are the main uncertainty
 in climate sensitivity.

Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then become heavy enough to fall under gravity.
 Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth.
 It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.
The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts.
 If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds
 (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands.
 In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain
 at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains. On the leeward side of
 mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass.
 The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes.
The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall, both in amounts and intensity, downwind of cities.
 Global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally, including wetter conditions across eastern
 North America and drier conditions in the tropics. Antarctica is the driest continent. The globally averaged annual precipitation over
 land is 715 mm (28.1 in), but over the whole Earth it is much higher at 990 mm (39 in). Climate classification systems such as the
 Köppen classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes.
 Rainfall is measured using rain gauges. Rainfall amounts can be estimated by weather radar.
Rain is also known or suspected on other planets, where it may be composed of methane, neon, sulfuric acid, or even iron rather than water.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is India's central bank and regulatory body and is responsible for the issue and supply of the
 Indian rupee and the regulation of the Indian banking system. It also manages the country's main payment systems and works to promote
 its economic development. Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran is one of the specialised divisions of RBI through which it prints &
 mints Indian bank notes and coins. RBI established the National Payments Corporation of India as one of its specialised division to
 regulate the payment and settlement systems in India. Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation was established by RBI as
 one of its specialised division for the purpose of providing insurance of deposits and guaranteeing of credit facilities to all Indian banks.
Until the Monetary Policy Committee was established in 2016, it also had full control over monetary policy in the country.
 It commenced its operations on 1 April 1935 in accordance with the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.
 The original share capital was divided into shares of 100 each fully paid. Following India's independence on 15 August 1947,
 the RBI was nationalised on 1 January 1949.
The overall direction of the RBI lies with the 21-member central board of directors, composed of: the governor;
 four deputy governors; two finance ministry representatives (usually the Economic Affairs Secretary and the Financial Services Secretary);
 ten government-nominated directors; and four directors who represent local boards for Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, and Delhi. Each of these
 local boards consists of five members who represent regional interests and the interests of co-operative and indigenous banks.
It is a member bank of the Asian Clearing Union. The bank is also active in promoting financial inclusion policy and is a leading 
member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI). The bank is often referred to by the name 'Mint Street'.
On 12 November 2021, the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, launched two new schemes which aim at expanding investments
 and ensuring more security for investors. The two new schemes include the RBI Retail Direct Scheme and the Reserve
 Bank Integrated Ombudsman Scheme. The RBI Retail Direct Scheme is targeted at retail investors to invest easily in government securities.
 According to RBI, the scheme will allow retail investors to open and maintain their government securities account free of cost.
 The RBI Integrated Ombudsman Scheme aims to further improve the grievance redress mechanism for resolving customer complaints 
against entities regulated by the central bank.

Snow comprises individual ice crystals that grow while suspended in the atmosphere—usually within clouds—and then fall,
 accumulating on the ground where they undergo further changes. It consists of frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle,
 starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate
 and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away.
Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air.
 Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets,
 which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets,
 needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses,
 by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form.
 Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.
Major snow-prone areas include the polar regions, the northernmost half of the Northern Hemisphere and mountainous
 regions worldwide with sufficient moisture and cold temperatures. In the Southern Hemisphere, snow is confined primarily
 to mountainous areas, apart from Antarctica.
Snow affects such human activities as transportation: creating the need for keeping roadways,
 wings, and windows clear; agriculture: providing water to crops and safeguarding livestock; sports such as skiing,
 snowboarding, and snowmachine travel; and warfare. Snow affects ecosystems, as well, by providing an insulating layer during winter
 under which plants and animals are able to survive the cold.

In rail transport, a train is a series of connected vehicles that run along a railway track and transport people or freight.
 The word train comes from the Old French trahiner, derived from the Latin trahere meaning "to pull, to draw".
 Trains are typically pulled or pushed by locomotives (often known simply as "engines"), though some are self-propelled, such as multiple units.
 Passengers and cargo are carried in railroad cars, also known as wagons. Trains are designed to a certain gauge, or distance between rails.
 Most trains operate on steel tracks with steel wheels, the low friction of which makes them more efficient than other forms of transport.
Trains have their roots in wagonways, which used railway tracks and were powered by horses or pulled by cables.
 Following the invention of the steam locomotive in the United Kingdom in 1804, trains rapidly spread around the world,
 allowing freight and passengers to move over land faster and cheaper than ever possible before.
 Rapid transit and trams were first built in the late 1800s to transport large numbers of people in and around cities.
 Beginning in the 1920s, and accelerating following World War II, diesel and electric locomotives replaced steam as the means of motive power.
 Following the development of cars, trucks, and extensive networks of highways which offered greater mobility, as well as faster airplanes,
 trains declined in importance and market share, and many rail lines were abandoned. The spread of buses led to the closure of many rapid
 transit and tram systems during this time as well.
Since the 1970s, governments, environmentalists, and train advocates have promoted increased use of trains due to their greater fuel
 efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to other modes of land transport. High-speed rail, first built in the 1960s,
 has proven competitive with cars and planes over short to medium distances. Commuter rail has grown in importance since the 1970s as
 an alternative to congested highways and a means to promote development, as has light rail in the 21st century. Freight trains remain
 important for the transport of bulk commodities such as coal and grain, as well as being a means of reducing road traffic congestion by 
freight trucks.
While conventional trains operate on relatively flat tracks with two rails, a number of specialized trains exist which are
 significantly different in their mode of operation. Monorails operate on a single rail, while funiculars and rack railways
 are uniquely designed to traverse steep slopes. Experimental trains such as high speed maglevs, which use magnetic levitation
 to float above a guideway, are under development in the 2020s and offer higher speeds than even the fastest conventional trains.
 Development of trains which use alternative fuels such as natural gas and hydrogen is another 21st century development.

A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle (such as a body of water, valley, road, or rail)
 without blocking the way underneath. It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle,
 which is usually something that is otherwise difficult or impossible to cross. There are many different designs of bridges,
 each serving a particular purpose and applicable to different situations. Designs of bridges vary depending on factors
 such as the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored,
 and the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it.
The earliest bridges were likely made with fallen trees and stepping stones.
 The Neolithic people built boardwalk bridges across marshland. The Arkadiko Bridge (dating from the 13th century BC, in the Peloponnese)
 is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use.

An airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport.
 Airports usually consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally
 active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off and to land or a helipad, and often includes adjacent utility
 buildings such as control towers, hangars and terminals, to maintain and monitor aircraft. Larger airports may have airport aprons,
 taxiway bridges, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services.
 In some countries, the US in particular, airports also typically have one or more fixed-base operators, serving general aviation.
Operating airports is extremely complicated, with a complex system of aircraft support services, passenger services, and aircraft
 control services contained within the operation. Thus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and
 other kinds of transit. Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have
 been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards. Additionally, airports have major local environmental impacts, as both
 large sources of air pollution, noise pollution and other environmental impacts, making them sites that acutely experience
 the environmental effects of aviation. Airports are also vulnerable infrastructure to extreme weather, climate change caused sea level
 rise and other disasters.

A continent is any of several large landmasses. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria,
 up to seven geographical regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in area to smallest,
 these seven regions are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.
 Variations with fewer continents may merge some of these, for example some systems include Afro-Eurasia, America or Eurasia as single continents.
 Zealandia, a largely submerged mass of continental crust, has also been described as a continent.
Oceanic islands are frequently grouped with a nearby continent to divide all the world's land into geographical regions.
 Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are grouped together with
 the continent of Australia to form a geographical region called Oceania.
In geology, a continent is defined as "one of Earth's major landmasses, including both dry land and continental shelves".
 The geological continents correspond to six large areas of continental crust that are found on the tectonic plates,
 but exclude small continental fragments such as Madagascar that are generally referred to as microcontinents.
 Continental crust is only known to exist on Earth.

The New 7 Wonders of the World was a campaign started in 2000 to choose Wonders of the World from a selection of 200 existing monuments.
 The popularity poll via free Web-based voting and small amounts of telephone voting was led by Canadian-Swiss Bernard Weber and organized
 by the New 7 Wonders Foundation (N7W) based in Zurich, Switzerland, with winners announced on 7 July 2007 in Lisbon, at Estádio da Luz.
 The poll was considered unscientific partly because it was possible for people to cast multiple votes.
 According to John Zogby, founder and current President/CEO of the Utica, New York-based polling organization Zogby International,
 New 7 Wonders Foundation drove "the largest poll on record".
The program drew a wide range of official reactions. Some countries touted their finalist and tried to get more votes cast for it,
 while others downplayed or criticized the contest. After supporting the New 7 Wonders Foundation at the beginning of the campaign
 by providing advice on nominee selection, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),
 by its bylaws having to record all and give equal status to world heritage sites, distanced itself from the undertaking in 2001 and again
 in 2007.
The seven winners were chosen from 21 candidates, which had been whittled down from 77 choices by a panel in 2006.
The New 7 Wonders Foundation, established in 2001, relied on private donations and the sale of broadcast rights and received no public funding.
 After the final announcement, New 7 Wonders said it did not earn anything from the exercise and barely recovered its investment.
 Although N7W describes itself as a not-for-profit organization, the company behind it—the New Open World Corporation (NOWC)
—is a commercial business. All licensing and sponsorship money is paid to NOWC.
The foundation ran two subsequent programs: New 7 Wonders of Nature, the subject of voting until 2011,
 and New7Wonders Cities, which ended in 2014.
The campaigns and the organization are sometimes spelled as multiple words and sometimes as a single word.

A currency in the most specific sense is money in any form when in use or circulation as a medium of exchange,
 especially circulating banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money (monetary units) in common use,
 especially for people in a nation. Under this definition, U.S. dollars , euros , Indian rupee , Japanese yen , and pounds sterling 
 are examples of currencies. Currencies may act as stores of value and be traded between nations in foreign exchange markets,
 which determine the relative values of the different currencies. Currencies in this sense are defined by governments,
 and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance.
Other definitions of the term "currency" appear in the respective synonymous articles: banknote, coin, and money.
 This article uses the definition which focuses on the currency systems of countries.
One can classify currencies into three monetary systems: fiat money, commodity money, and representative money,
 depending on what guarantees a currency's value (the economy at large vs. the government's physical metal reserves).
 Some currencies function as legal tender in certain political jurisdictions. Others simply get traded for their economic value.
Digital currency has arisen with the popularity of computers and the Internet. Whether digital notes and coins will
 be successfully developed remains dubious. Decentralized digital currencies, such as cryptocurrencies are not legal currency,
 strictly speaking, since they are not issued by a government monetary authority (although one of them, Bitcoin, has become legal
 tender in El Salvador). Many warnings issued by various countries note the opportunities that cryptocurrencies create for illegal activities,
 such as money laundering and terrorism. In 2014 the United States IRS issued a statement explaining that virtual currency is treated 
as property for Federal income-tax purposes and providing examples of how longstanding tax principles applicable to transactions involving
 property apply to virtual currency.

Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts,
 such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context. The main functions of money are distinguished as:
 a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment.
 Any item or verifiable record that fulfils these functions can be considered as money.
Money is historically an emergent market phenomenon establishing a commodity money, but nearly all contemporary money systems are based on
 fiat money. Fiat money, like any check or note of debt, is without use value as a physical commodity.
 It derives its value by being declared by a government to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment
 within the boundaries of the country, for "all debts, public and private". Counterfeit money can cause good money to lose its value.
The money supply of a country consists of currency (banknotes and coins) and, depending on the particular definition used,
 one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts).
 Bank money, which consists only of records (mostly computerized in modern banking), forms by far the largest part of broad money
 in developed countries.

The World Bank is an international financial institution that provides loans and grants to the governments of low- and middle-income
 countries for the purpose of pursuing capital projects.[5] The World Bank is the collective name for the International Bank for
 Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA), two of five international organizations
 owned by the World Bank Group. It was established along with the International Monetary Fund at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference.
 After a slow start, its first loan was to France in 1947. In the 1970s, it focused on loans to developing world countries, shifting
 away from that mission in the 1980s. For the last 30 years, it has included NGOs and environmental groups in its loan portfolio.
 Its loan strategy is influenced by the Millennium Development Goals as well as environmental and social safeguards.
The World Bank is run by a president and 25 executive directors, as well as 29 various vice presidents.
 IBRD and IDA have 189 and 174 member countries, respectively. The U.S., Japan, China, Germany and the U.K. have the most voting power.
 The bank aims loans at developing countries to help reduce poverty. The bank is engaged in several global partnerships and initiatives,
 and takes a role in working toward addressing climate change. The World Bank operates a number of training wings and it works with the
 Clean Air Initiative and the UN Development Business. It works within the Open Data Initiative and hosts an Open Knowledge Repository.
The World Bank has been criticized as promoting inflation and harming economic development.
 The way it is governed has been criticized. There have been major protests against the bank.
 There has also been criticism of the bank’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, generally a state.
In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary.
 Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining policy.
 In many countries, the government has a kind of constitution, a statement of its governing principles and philosophy.
While all types of organizations have governance, the term government is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately
 200 independent national governments and subsidiary organizations.
Historically prevalent forms of government include monarchy, aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy,
 democracy, theocracy and tyranny. The main aspect of any philosophy of government is how political power is obtained,
 with the two main forms being electoral contest and hereditary succession.

World War I occurred from 1914 to 1918. In terms of human technological history, the scale of World War I was enabled by the
 technological advances of the second industrial revolution and the resulting globalization that allowed global power projection
 and mass production of military hardware. It had been recognized that the complex system of opposing military alliances
 (the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires against the British, Russian, and French Empires) was likely, if war broke out,
 to lead to a worldwide conflict. That caused a very minute conflict between two countries to have the potential to set off
 a domino effect of alliances, triggering a world war. The fact that the powers involved had large overseas empires virtually
 guaranteed that such a war would be worldwide, as the colonies' resources would be a crucial strategic factor.
 The same strategic considerations also ensured that the combatants would strike at each other's colonies, thus spreading
 the wars far more widely than those of pre-Columbian times.
War crimes were perpetrated in World War I. Chemical weapons were used in the war despite the Hague Conventions of 1899
 and 1907 having outlawed the use of such weapons in warfare. The Ottoman Empire was responsible for the Armenian genocide,
 the murder of more than 1,000,000 Armenians during the First World War, as well as the other late Ottoman genocides.

The Second World War occurred from 1939 to 1945 and is the only conflict in which nuclear weapons have been used; both Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
 in the Japanese Empire, were devastated by atomic bombs dropped by the United States. Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler,
 was responsible for genocides, most notably the Holocaust, the killing of about 6,000,000 Jews and 11,000,000 others persecuted by the Nazis,
 including Romani people and homosexuals. The United States, the Soviet Union, and Canada deported and interned minority groups within
 their own borders and, largely because of the conflict, many ethnic Germans were later expelled from Eastern Europe.
 Japan was responsible for attacking neutral nations without a declaration of war, such as the attack on Pearl Harbor.
 It is also known for its brutal treatment and killing of Allied prisoners of war and the inhabitants of Asia. 
It also used Asians as forced laborers and was responsible for the Nanking massacre in which 250,000 civilians were brutally
 murdered by Japanese troops. Noncombatants suffered at least as badly as or worse than combatants, and the distinction
 between combatants and noncombatants was often blurred by the belligerents of total war in both conflicts.
The outcome of the war had a profound effect on the course of world history.
 The old European empires collapsed or were dismantled as a direct result of the wars'
 crushing costs and, in some cases, their fall was caused by the defeat of imperial powers.
 The United States became firmly established as the dominant global superpower, along with its ideological foe,
 the Soviet Union, in close competition. The two superpowers exerted political influence over most of the world's nation-states
 for decades after the end of the Second World War. The modern international security, economic, and diplomatic system was created
 in the aftermath of the wars.
Institutions such as the United Nations were established to collectivize international affairs,
 with the explicit goal of preventing another outbreak of general war. The wars had also greatly
 changed the course of daily life. Technologies developed during wartime had a profound effect on peacetime life as well,
 such as by advances in jet aircraft, penicillin, nuclear energy, and electronic computers.

A weapon, arm or armament is any implement or device that can be used with the intent to inflict physical damage or harm.
 Weapons are used to increase the efficacy and efficiency of activities such as hunting, crime, law enforcement, self-defense, and warfare.
 In broader context, weapons may be construed to include anything used to gain a tactical, strategic, material or mental advantage over
 an adversary or enemy target.
While ordinary objects – sticks, rocks, bottles, chairs, vehicles – can be used as weapons,
 many are expressly designed for the purpose; these range from simple implements such as clubs, axes and swords,
 to complicated modern firearms, tanks, intercontinental ballistic missiles, biological weapons, and cyberweapons.
 Something that has been re-purposed, converted, or enhanced to become a weapon of war is termed weaponized, such as
 a weaponized virus or weaponized laser.

An army, ground force or land force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land.
 In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or country.
 It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component. Within a national military force, the word army may
 also mean a field army.
In some countries, such as France and China, the term "army", especially in its plural form "armies",
 has the broader meaning of armed forces as a whole, while retaining the colloquial sense of land forces.
 To differentiate the colloquial army from the formal concept of military force, the term is qualified,
 for example in France the land force is called Armée de terre, meaning Land Army, meaning Air and Space Army. 
The naval force, although not using the term "army", is also included in the broad sense of the term "armies" — thus the French Navy 
is an integral component of the collective French Armies (French Armed Forces) under the Ministry of the Armies. 
A similar pattern is seen in China, with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) being the overall military,
 the land force being the PLA Ground Force, and so forth for the PLA Air Force, the PLA Navy, and other branches.
 By convention, irregular military is understood in contrast to regular armies which grew slowly from personal bodyguards
 or elite militia. Regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc. 
Regular military can also refer to full-time status (standing army), versus reserve or part-time personnel.
 Other distinctions may separate statutory forces (established under laws such as the National Defence Act), 
from de facto "non-statutory" forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies. Armies may also be expeditionary
 (designed for overseas or international deployment) or fencible (designed for – or restricted to – homeland defence).

Security is protection from, or resilience against, potential harm (or other unwanted coercive change) caused by others,
 by restraining the freedom of others to act. Beneficiaries (technically referents) of security may be of persons and social groups,
 objects and institutions, ecosystems or any other entity or phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change.
Refugees fleeing war and insecurity in Iraq and Syria arrive at Lesbos Island, supported by Spanish volunteers, 2015
Security mostly refers to protection from hostile forces, but it has a wide range of other senses: for example,
 as the absence of harm (e.g. freedom from want); as the presence of an essential good (e.g. food security);
 as resilience against potential damage or harm (e.g. secure foundations); as secrecy (e.g. a secure telephone line);
 as containment (e.g. a secure room or cell); and as a state of mind (e.g. emotional security).
The term is also used to refer to acts and systems whose purpose may be to provide security 
(e.g.: security companies, security forces, security guard, cyber security systems, security cameras, remote guarding).
Security is not only physical but it can also be virtual.

In political science, a revolution is a fundamental and relatively sudden change in political power and political organization which 
occurs when the population revolts against the government, typically due to perceived oppression (political, social, economic)
 or political incompetence.
Revolutions have occurred throughout human history and vary widely in terms of methods,
 duration and motivating ideology. Their results include major changes in culture, economy, and socio-political institutions,
 usually in response to perceived overwhelming autocracy or plutocracy.
Scholarly debates about what does and does not constitute a revolution center on several issues.
 Early studies of revolutions primarily analyzed events in European history from a psychological perspective,
 but more modern examinations include global events and incorporate perspectives from several social sciences,
 including sociology and political science. Several generations of scholarly thought on revolutions have generated many
 competing theories and contributed much to the current understanding of this complex phenomenon.
Notable revolutions in recent centuries include the creation of the United States through the American Revolutionary
 War (1775–1783), the French Revolution (1789–1799), the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804), the Spanish American wars of independence 
(1808–1826), the European Revolutions of 1848, the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Chinese Revolution of the 1940s, the Cuban Revolution in 1959,
 the Iranian Revolution in 1979, and the European Revolutions of 1989.

A president is a leader of an organization, company, community, club, trade union, university or other group.
 The relationship between a president and a chief executive officer varies, depending on the structure of the specific organization.
 In a similar vein to a chief operating officer, the title of corporate president as a separate position 
(as opposed to being combined with a "C-suite" designation, such as "president and chief executive officer" or "president and chief
 operating officer") is also loosely defined; the president is usually the legally recognized highest rank of corporate officer,
 ranking above the various vice presidents (including senior vice president and executive vice president),
 but on its own generally considered subordinate, in practice, to the CEO. The powers of a president vary widely across 
organizations and such powers come from specific authorization in the bylaws like Robert's Rules of Order (e.g. the president
 can make an "executive decision" only if the bylaws allow for it).

A tank is an armored fighting vehicle intended as a primary offensive weapon in front-line ground combat.
 Tank designs are a balance of heavy firepower, strong armor, and good battlefield mobility provided by tracks and a powerful engine;
 usually their main armament is mounted in a turret.
 They are a mainstay of modern 20th and 21st century ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat.
Modern tanks are versatile mobile land weapons platforms whose main armament is a large-caliber tank gun mounted in a rotating gun turret,
 supplemented by machine guns or other ranged weapons such as anti-tank guided missiles or rocket launchers.
 They have heavy vehicle armor which provides protection for the crew, the vehicle's munition storage,
 fuel tank and propulsion systems. The use of tracks rather than wheels provides improved operational mobility which allows the tank to
 overcome rugged terrain and adverse conditions such as mud and ice/snow better than wheeled vehicles, and thus be more flexibly
 positioned at advantageous locations on the battlefield. These features enable the tank to perform well in a variety of intense combat
 situations, simultaneously both offensively (with direct fire from their powerful main gun) and defensively (as fire support and defilade
 for friendly troops due to the near invulnerability to common infantry small arms and good resistance against most heavier weapons),
 all while maintaining the mobility needed to exploit changing tactical situations. Fully integrating tanks into modern military
 forces spawned a new era of combat: armored warfare.
Until the arrival of the main battle tank, tanks were typically categorized either by weight class
 (light, medium, heavy or superheavy tanks) or doctrinal purpose (breakthrough-, cavalry-, infantry-, cruiser-, or reconnaissance tanks).
 Some being larger and very heavily armored and with large guns, while others are smaller, lightly armored, and equipped with a smaller
 caliber and lighter gun. These smaller tanks move over terrain with speed and agility and can perform a reconnaissance role
 in addition to engaging enemy targets. The smaller, faster tank would not normally engage in battle with a larger,
 heavily armored tank, except during a surprise flanking manoeuvre.

Light or visible light is electromagnetic radiation within the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is perceived by the human eye.
 Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nanometres (nm),
 corresponding to frequencies of 750-420 terahertz, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) 
and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths).
In physics, the term "light" may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength,
 whether visible or not. In this sense, gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light.
 The primary properties of light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum and polarization.
 Its speed in a vacuum, 299 792 458 metres a second (m/s), is one of the fundamental constants of nature.
 Like all types of electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates by massless elementary particles called photons that represents
 the quanta of electromagnetic field, and can be analyzed as both waves and particles. The study of light, known as optics,
 is an important research area in modern physics.
The main source of light on Earth is the Sun. Historically, another important source of light for humans has been fire,
 from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps. With the development of electric lights and power systems,
 electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight.

`
A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting
 in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky. It takes the form of a multicoloured circular arc. Rainbows caused by sunlight always
 appear in the section of sky directly opposite the Sun.
Rainbows can be full circles. However, the observer normally sees only an arc formed by illuminated droplets above the ground,
 and centered on a line from the Sun to the observer's eye.
In a primary rainbow, the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side.
 This rainbow is caused by light being refracted when entering a droplet of water, then reflected inside on the back of the
 droplet and refracted again when leaving it.
In a double rainbow, a second arc is seen outside the primary arc, and has the order of its colours reversed,
 with red on the inner side of the arc. This is caused by the light being reflected twice on the inside of the droplet before leaving it.

Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton,
 five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head.
 Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the rays.
 However, the term "shark" has also been (incorrectly) used to refer to extinct members of the subclass Elasmobranchii,
 which are technically outside the Selachimorpha clade. Notable examples of improper classification include Cladoselache,
 Xenacanthus, and various other members of the Chondrichthyes class like the holocephalid eugenedontidans.
Under this broader definition, the earliest known sharks date back to more than 420 million years ago.
 Acanthodians are often referred to as "spiny sharks"; though they are not part of Chondrichthyes proper,
 they are a paraphyletic assemblage leading to cartilaginous fish as a whole. Since then, sharks have diversified into over 500 species.
 They range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus perryi), a deep sea species that is only 17 centimetres 
(6.7 in) in length, to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the world, which reaches approximately 12 metres
 (40 ft) in length. Sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths up to 2,000 metres (6,600 ft).
 They generally do not live in freshwater, although there are a few known exceptions, such as the bull shark and the river shark,
 which can be found in both seawater and freshwater. Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage
 and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics. They have numerous sets of replaceable teeth.
Several species are apex predators, which are organisms that are at the top of their food chain.
 Select examples include the tiger shark, blue shark, great white shark, mako shark, thresher shark, and hammerhead shark.
Sharks are caught by humans for shark meat or shark fin soup. Many shark populations are threatened by human activities.
 Since 1970, shark populations have been reduced by 71%, mostly from overfishing.

A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically.
 Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks.
 A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software)
, and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation.
 This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.
A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems.
 Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots 
and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones.
 Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.
Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing
 calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks,
 such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century.
 The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II.
 The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor)
 and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip technologies in the late 1950s,
 leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s.
 The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then,
 with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during
 the late 20th to early 21st centuries.
Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU)
 in the form of a microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips.
 The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations
 in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices
 (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). 
Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.

Time management is the process of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific activities,
 especially to increase effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity.
 It involves the balancing of various demands upon a person relating to work, social life, family, hobbies, personal interests,
 and commitments with the finite nature of time. Using time effectively gives the person "choice" on spending or managing activities 
at their own time and expediency. Time management may be aided by a range of skills, tools, and techniques used to manage time when
 accomplishing specific tasks, projects, and goals complying with a due date. Initially, time management referred to just business or
 work activities, but eventually, the term broadened to include personal activities as well. A time management system is a designed
 combination of processes, tools, techniques, and methods. Time management is usually a necessity in any project management as it
 determines the project completion time and scope.

Program management or programme management is the process of managing several related projects,
 often with the intention of improving an organization's performance. In practice and in its aims,
 program management is often closely related to systems engineering, industrial engineering, change
 management, and business transformation. In the defense sector, it is the dominant approach to managing very large projects.
 Because major defense programs entail working with contractors, it is often called acquisition management, indicating that the government
 buyer acquires goods and services by means of contractors.
The program manager has oversight of the purpose and status of the projects in a program and can use this oversight
 to support project-level activity to ensure the program goals are met by providing a decision-making capacity that cannot be
 achieved at project level or by providing the project manager with a program perspective when required, or as a sounding board
 for ideas and approaches to solving project issues that have program impacts. The program manager may be well-placed to provide
 this insight by actively seeking out such information from the project managers although in large and/or complex projects,
 a specific role may be required. However this insight arises, the program manager needs this in order to be comfortable that
 the overall program goals are achievable.

A programming language is any set of rules that converts strings, or graphical program elements in the case of visual programming languages,
 to various kinds of machine code output. Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming
 to implement algorithms.
Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions,
 rather than general programming languages. Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard
 looms, music boxes and player pianos. The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different
 behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.
Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year.
 Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform)
 while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).
The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form)
 and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language. 
Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard)
 while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both,
 with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.
Programming language theory is a subfield of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis,
 characterization, and classification of programming languages.

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
 It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),
 meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.
 Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer
 architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
 The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available
 in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,
 particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems'
 Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released
 by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process,
 Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine,
 however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and
 is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.
As of March 2022, Java 18 is the latest version, while Java 17, 11 and 8 are the current long-term support (LTS) versions.
 Oracle released the last zero-cost public update for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for commercial use,
 although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use indefinitely.
 Other vendors have begun to offer zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 8 and 11 that are still receiving security and other upgrades.
Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated and unsupported versions of Java,
 due to unresolved security issues in older versions.[22] Oracle advises its users to immediately
 transition to a supported version, such as one of the LTS versions (8, 11, 17).

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of
 significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for
 small- and large-scale projects.
Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural),
 object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991
 as Python 0.9.0.[33] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions,
 cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.
 Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions.
 Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.
Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.

JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
 alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,
 often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
 It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven,
 functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text,
 dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.
 In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications.
 The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries,
 the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development.
 It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.
 The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,
 but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module,
 a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code
 – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of an HTTP response.
 Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or
 facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context,
 such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.
The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License.
 PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.
The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014,
 with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow.
 Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.
W3Techs reports that, as of January 2022, "PHP is used by 78.1% of all the websites whose server-side programming language we know."
 PHP version 7.4 is the most used version. Support for version 7.3 was dropped on 6 December 2021.

 A non-fungible token (NFT) is a non-interchangeable[clarification needed] unit of data stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger,
 that can be sold and traded. Types of NFT data units may be associated with digital files such as photos, videos, and audio.
 Because each token is uniquely identifiable, NFTs differ from blockchain cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin.
NFT ledgers claim to provide a public certificate of authenticity or proof of ownership, but the legal rights conveyed by an NFT can be uncertain.
 NFTs do not restrict the sharing or copying of the underlying digital files, do not necessarily convey the copyright of the digital files,
 and do not prevent the creation of NFTs with identical associated files.
NFTs have been used as a speculative asset, and they have drawn increasing criticism for the energy cost and carbon footprint associated
 with validating blockchain transactions as well as their frequent use in art scams. The NFT market has been compared to a Ponzi scheme.

A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography.
 Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).
 The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published to get into its hash.
 As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it.
 Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot
 be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.
Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network for use as a publicly distributed ledger,
 where nodes collectively adhere to a protocol to communicate and validate new blocks.
 Although blockchain records are not unalterable as forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and
 exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.
The blockchain was popularized by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public
 transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, based on work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.
 The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to date. The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital
 currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server.
 The bitcoin design has inspired other applications and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies.
 The blockchain is considered a type of payment rail.
Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without
 a proper security model "snake oil"; however, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed,
 may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than permissionless ones.

A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network
 that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.
Individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger, which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to
 secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.
 Despite their name, cryptocurrencies are not necessarily considered to be currencies in the traditional sense and while varying categorical
 treatments have been applied to them, including classification as commodities, securities, as well as currencies, cryptocurrencies are
 generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice. Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency.
 In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. In return, they get authority over the token in proportion to
 the amount they stake. Generally, these token stakers get additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted
 tokens or other such reward mechanisms.
Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority.
 Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).
 When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized.
 When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain,
 that serves as a public financial transaction database.
A cryptocurrency is a tradable digital asset or digital form of money, built on blockchain technology that only exists online.
 Cryptocurrencies use encryption to authenticate and protect transactions, hence their name.
 There are currently over a thousand different cryptocurrencies in the world.
Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is the first decentralized cryptocurrency.
 Since the release of bitcoin, many other cryptocurrencies have been created.

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator,
 that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.
 Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.
 The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.
 The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software.
Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services.
 Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, the large amount of electricity (and thus carbon footprint) used by mining,
 price volatility, and thefts from exchanges. Some investors and economists have characterized it as a speculative bubble at various times.
 Others have used it as an investment, although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin.
A few local and national governments are officially using Bitcoin in some capacity, with one country,
 El Salvador, adopting it as a legal tender.
The word bitcoin was defined in a white paper published on 31 October 2008.
 It is a compound of the words bit and coin.[15] No uniform convention for bitcoin capitalization exists; some sources use Bitcoin,
 capitalized, to refer to the technology and network and bitcoin, lowercase, for the unit of account.
 The Wall Street Journal, The Chronicle of Higher Education, and the Oxford English Dictionary advocate the use of lowercase bitcoin in all cases.

A smartphone is a portable device that combines mobile telephone and computing functions into one unit.
 They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems,
 which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality 
(including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging.
 Smartphones typically contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC)
 chips, include various sensors that can be leveraged by pre-included and third-party software
 (such as a magnetometer, proximity sensors, barometer, gyroscope, accelerometer and more), and support wireless
 communications protocols (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or satellite navigation).
Early smartphones were marketed primarily towards the enterprise market, attempting to bridge the functionality of standalone personal
 digital assistant (PDA) devices with support for cellular telephony, but were limited by their bulky form, short battery life,
 slow analog cellular networks, and the immaturity of wireless data services. These issues were eventually resolved with the
 exponential scaling and miniaturization of MOS transistors down to sub-micron levels (Moore's law), the improved lithium-ion battery,
 faster digital mobile data networks (Edholm's law), and more mature software platforms that allowed mobile device ecosystems to
 develop independently of data providers.
In the 2000s, NTT DoCoMo's i-mode platform, BlackBerry, Nokia's Symbian platform,
 and Windows Mobile began to gain market traction, with models often featuring QWERTY keyboards or resistive touchscreen input,
 and emphasizing access to push email and wireless internet. Following the rising popularity of the iPhone in the late 2000s,
 the majority of smartphones have featured thin, slate-like form factors, with large, capacitive screens with support for multi-touch
 gestures rather than physical keyboards, and offer the ability for users to download or purchase additional applications from a
 centralized store, and use cloud storage and synchronization, virtual assistants, as well as mobile payment services.
 Smartphones have largely replaced PDAs, handheld/palm-sized PCs and portable media players (PMP).
Improved hardware and faster wireless communication (due to standards such as LTE) have bolstered the growth of the smartphone industry.
 In the third quarter of 2012, one billion smartphones were in use worldwide.
 Global smartphone sales surpassed the sales figures for feature phones in early 2013.

A laptop, laptop computer, or notebook computer is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with a screen and alphanumeric keyboard.
 Laptops typically have a clam shell form factor with the screen mounted on the inside of the upper lid and the keyboard on the inside
 of the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as having a laptop mode.
 Laptops are folded shut for transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.
 Its name comes from lap, as it was deemed practical to be placed on a person's lap when being used.
 Today, laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education, for playing games, web browsing, for personal multimedia,
 and for general home computer use.
As of 2021, in American English, the terms laptop computer and notebook computer are used interchangeably;
 in other dialects of English, one or the other may be preferred. Although the terms notebook computers or notebooks originally
 referred to a specific size of laptop (originally smaller and lighter than mainstream laptops of the time),
 the terms have come to mean the same thing and notebook no longer refers to any specific size.
Laptops combine all the input/output components and capabilities of a desktop computer, including the display screen,
 small speakers, a keyboard, data storage device, sometimes an optical disc drive, pointing devices 
(such as a touch pad or pointing stick), with an operating system, a processor and memory into a single unit.
 Most modern laptops feature integrated webcams and built-in microphones, while many also have touchscreens.
 Laptops can be powered either from an internal battery or by an external power supply from an AC adapter.
 Hardware specifications, such as the processor speed and memory capacity, significantly vary between different types, models and price points.
Design elements, form factor and construction can also vary significantly between models depending on the intended use.
 Examples of specialized models of laptops include rugged notebooks for use in construction or military applications,
 as well as low production cost laptops such as those from the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) organization,
 which incorporate features like solar charging and semi-flexible components not found on most laptop computers.
 Portable computers, which later developed into modern laptops, were originally considered to be a small niche market,
 mostly for specialized field applications, such as in the military, for accountants, or traveling sales representatives.
 As portable computers evolved into modern laptops, they became widely used for a variety of purposes.

The MacBook Air is Apple's least expensive notebook computer. While the 1st generation was released as a premium ultraportable positioned
 above the 2006 - 2012 MacBook, lowered prices on subsequent iterations and the discontinuation of that MacBook has made it serve as the
 entry-level Macintosh portable. The 2010 to 2017 base model came with a 13-inch screen and was Apple's thinnest notebook 
computer until the introduction of the MacBook in March 2015. This MacBook Air model features two USB Type-A 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 2 port,
 as well as an SDXC card slot (only on the 13inch model). This model of MacBook Air did not have a Retina Display.
 A MacBook Air model with an 11-inch screen was available from October 2010 to October 2016.
 In 2017, the MacBook Air received a small refresh, with the processor speed increased to 1.8 GHz.
On October 30, 2018, the MacBook Air underwent a major design change, dropping the USB Type-A ports, MagSafe,
 and the SD card slot in favor of two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. It was updated with a Retina display and Intel
 Y-series Amber Lake i5 CPUs, as well as a Force Touch trackpad, a third-generation butterfly mechanism keyboard, 
and the Touch ID sensor found in the fourth-generation MacBook Pro, but without the Touch Bar.
 The base price was also raised, although the base configuration of the 2017 model was retained until July 9, 2019,
 when it was discontinued along with the Retina MacBook. The base price of this model was also dropped 
to $1099 ($999 for students) on the same day.
On November 10, 2020, Apple announced that the MacBook Air would use the new Apple M1 system on a chip.
 The new Air does not have a fan, ensuring silent operation, but limiting the M1 chip speed in sustained operations.
 Performance was claimed to be higher than most current Intel laptops.

Instagram is an American photo and video sharing social networking service founded by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.
 In April 2012, Facebook Inc. acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock.
 The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging.
 Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations and view trending
 content. Users can like photos and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.
Instagram was originally distinguished by only allowing content to be framed in a square (1:1) aspect ratio with 640 pixels to
 match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, these restrictions were eased with an increase to 1080 pixels.
 The service also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a 'stories' 
feature—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which allows users to post photos and videos to a sequential feed,
 with each post accessible by others for 24 hours each. As of January 2019, the Stories feature is used by 500 million users daily.
Originally launched for iOS in October 2010, Instagram rapidly gained popularity,
 with one million registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion as of June 2018.
 The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014,
 and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. As of October 2015, over 40 billion photos had been uploaded.
 Although praised for its influence, Instagram has been the subject of criticism, most notably for the negative impact on teens' mental health,
 policy and interface changes, allegations of censorship, and illegal or improper content uploaded by users.

WhatsApp Messenger, or simply WhatsApp, is an internationally available American freeware, cross-platform centralized instant messaging (IM)
 and voice-over-IP (VoIP) service owned by Meta Platforms. It allows users to send text messages and voice messages,
 make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other content.
 WhatsApp's client application runs on mobile devices but is also accessible from desktop computers, as long as the user's mobile device
 remains connected to the Internet while they use the desktop app. The service requires a cellular mobile telephone number to sign up.
 In January 2018, WhatsApp released a standalone business app targeted at small business owners, called WhatsApp Business, to allow
 companies to communicate with customers who use the standard WhatsApp client.
The client application was created by WhatsApp Inc. of Mountain View, California, which was acquired by Facebook in February 2014
 for approximately US$19.3 billion. It became the world's most popular messaging application by 2015,
 and had more than 2 billion users worldwide by February 2020. By 2016 it had become the primary means of Internet communication
 in regions including Latin America, the Indian subcontinent, and large parts of Europe and Africa.

Facebook is an American online social media and social networking service owned by Meta Platforms.
 Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz,
 and Chris Hughes, its name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students.
 Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities and, since 2006,
 anyone over 13 years old. As of 2020, Facebook claimed 2.8 billion monthly active users, and ranked fourth in global internet usage.
 It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.
Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones.
 After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves.
 They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their "friend" or, with
 different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate directly with each other with Facebook Messenger, join common-interest groups,
 and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow.
The subject of numerous controversies, Facebook has often been criticized over issues such as user privacy 
(as with the Cambridge Analytica data scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S. elections), mass surveillance,
 psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and content such as fake news, conspiracy theories,
 copyright infringement, and hate speech. Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content,
 as well as exaggerating its number of users to appeal to advertisers.

Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively
 developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed,
 non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).
Git was originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel,
 with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer.
 As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer
 is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.
 Git is free and open-source software distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license.

Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.
 Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library,
 but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.
 Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React) 
or native code via LLVM (e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps).
 Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.
On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language is now its preferred language for Android app developers.
 Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 in October 2017, Kotlin has been included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler.
 The Android Kotlin compiler produces Java 8 bytecode by default (which runs in any later JVM), but lets the programmer choose to target
 Java 9 up to 17, for optimization, or allows for more features; has bidirectional record class interoperability support for JVM,
 introduced in Java 16, considered stable as of Kotlin 1.5.
Kotlin support for compilation directly to JavaScript (i.e., the classic back-end) is considered stable since version 1.3,
 while the new Kotlin/JS(IR) is in beta as of version 1.5.30. The new optimized implementations of Kotlin/JVM(IR) and Kotlin/JS (IR-based)
 were introduced in version 1.4. Kotlin/JVM(IR) is considered stable and enabled by default since version 1.5. Kotlin/Native
 (for e.g. Apple silicon support) is considered beta since version 1.3.

YouTube is an American online video sharing and social media platform owned by Google.
 It was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim.
 It is the second most visited website, right after Google itself. YouTube has more than one billion monthly users who collectively watch
 more than one billion hours of videos each day. As of May 2019, videos were being uploaded at a rate of more than
 500 hours of content per minute.
In October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion. Google's ownership of YouTube has also changed its business model;
 it no longer generates revenue from advertisements alone, YouTube now offers paid content such as movies and exclusive content produced by
 YouTube. It also offers a paid subscription option for watching content without ads, YouTube Premium.
 YouTube and approved creators participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties.
 YouTube's reported revenue for 2020 was $19.8 billion.
Since its purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network television, and the ability to link
 with other platforms. Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips, news, short films, feature films, documentaries,
 audio recordings, movie trailers, teasers, live streams, vlogs, and more.
 Most content is generated by individuals, including collaborations between YouTubers and corporate sponsors.
 Established media corporations such as Disney, Paramount Global, and WarnerMedia have also created and expanded their corporate
 YouTube channels to advertise to a larger audience.
YouTube has had an unprecedented social impact, influencing popular culture, internet trends,
 and creating multimillionaire celebrities. Despite all its growth and success, YouTube has been widely criticized.
 Criticism of YouTube includes the website being used to facilitate the spread of misinformation, copyright issues,
 routine violations of its users' privacy, enabling censorship, and endangering child safety and wellbeing.

Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food.
 The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter,
 including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An alternative definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily,
 often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains,
 but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.
Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world,
 probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed.
 At first, plants which grew locally would have been cultivated, but as time went on, trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add
 to domestic types. Nowadays, most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits, and crops may be cultivated in protected
 environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables, and global trade in agricultural products allows
 consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs
 of their family for food, to agribusinesses with vast acreages of single-product crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned,
 harvesting the crop is followed by grading, storing, processing, and marketing.
Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition,
 being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates, but high in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber.
 Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables, five or more portions a day often being recommended.

Animation is a method in which figures are manipulated to appear as moving images.
 In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film.
 Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation,
 while 2D computer animation (which may have the look of traditional animation) can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth,
 or faster real-time renderings. Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two- and three-dimensional objects like paper
 cutouts, puppets, or clay figures.
An animated cartoon is an animated film, usually a short film, featuring an exaggerated visual style.
 The style takes inspiration from comic strips, often featuring anthropomorphic animals, superheroes,
 or the adventures of human protagonists (either children or adults). Especially with animals that form a natural predator/prey relationship
 (e.g. cats and mice, coyotes and birds), the action often centers around violent pratfalls such as falls, collisions, and explosions that
 would be lethal in real life.
The illusion of animation—as in motion pictures in general—has traditionally been attributed to persistence of vision and
 later to the phi phenomenon and/or beta movement, but the exact neurological causes are still uncertain.
 The illusion of motion caused by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other, with unnoticeable interruptions,
 is a stroboscopic effect. While animators traditionally used to draw each part of the movements and changes of figures on transparent cels
 that could be moved over a separate background, computer animation is usually based on programming paths between key frames to maneuver
 digitally created figures throughout a digitally created environment.
Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope,
 zoetrope, flip book, praxinoscope, and film. Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog
 and now operate digitally. For display on computers, technology such as the animated GIF and Flash animation were developed.
In addition to short films, feature films, television series, animated GIFs, and other media dedicated to the display of moving images,
 animation is also prevalent in video games, motion graphics, user interfaces, and visual effects.
The physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics—for instance moving images in magic lantern
 shows—can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living
 beings has a very long history in automata. Electronic automata were popularized by Disney as animatronics.

Graphics 'pertaining to drawing, painting, writing, etc.') are visual images or designs on some surface, such as a wall, canvas, screen, paper,
 or stone, to inform, illustrate, or entertain. In contemporary usage, it includes a pictorial representation of data,
 as in design and manufacture, in typesetting and the graphic arts, and in educational and recreational software.
 Images that are generated by a computer are called computer graphics.
Examples are photographs, drawings, line art, mathematical graphs, line graphs, charts, diagrams, typography, numbers, symbols,
 geometric designs, maps, engineering drawings, or other images. Graphics often combine text, illustration, and color.
 Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone,
 as in a brochure, flyer, poster, web site, or book without any other element. The objective can be clarity or effective communication,
 association with other cultural elements, or merely the creation of a distinctive style.
Graphics can be functional or artistic. The latter can be a recorded version, such as a photograph, or interpretation by a scientist to
 highlight essential features, or an artist, in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics may become blurred.
 It can also be used for architecture.

Royal Enfield was a brand name under which The Enfield Cycle Company Limited of Redditch, Worcestershire sold motorcycles, bicycles,
 lawnmowers and stationary engines which they had manufactured. Enfield Cycle Company also used the brand name "Enfield" without the "Royal".
The first Royal Enfield motorcycle was built in 1901. The Enfield Cycle Company is responsible for the design and original production
 of the Royal Enfield Bullet, the longest-lived motorcycle design in history.
Royal Enfield's spare parts operation was sold to Velocette in 1967, which benefitted from the arrangement for three years until
 their closure in early 1971. Enfield's remaining motorcycle business became part of Norton Villiers in 1967 with the business
 eventually closing in 1978.

A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the
 light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers. Liquid crystals do not emit light directly,
instead using a backlight or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome.
 LCDs are available to display arbitrary images (as in a general-purpose computer display) or fixed images with low information content,
 which can be displayed or hidden. For instance: preset words, digits, and seven-segment displays, as in a digital clock, are all
 good examples of devices with these displays. They use the same basic technology, except that arbitrary images are made from a matrix
 of small pixels, while other displays have larger elements. LCDs can either be normally on (positive) or off (negative),
 depending on the polarizer arrangement. For example, a character positive LCD with a backlight will have black lettering on a
 background that is the color of the backlight, and a character negative LCD will have a black background with the letters being
 of the same color as the backlight. Optical filters are added to white on blue LCDs to give them their characteristic appearance.
LCDs are used in a wide range of applications, including LCD televisions, computer monitors, instrument panels, aircraft cockpit displays,
 and indoor and outdoor signage. Small LCD screens are common in LCD projectors and portable consumer devices such as digital cameras,
 watches, digital clocks, calculators, and mobile telephones, including smartphones. LCD screens are also used on consumer electronics
 products such as DVD players, video game devices and clocks. LCD screens have replaced heavy, bulky cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays
 in nearly all applications. LCD screens are available in a wider range of screen sizes than CRT and plasma displays, with
 LCD screens available in sizes ranging from tiny digital watches to very large television receivers.
 LCDs are slowly being replaced by OLEDs, which can be easily made into different shapes, and have a lower response time,
 wider color gamut, virtually infinite color contrast and viewing angles, lower weight for a given display size and a slimmer profile
 (because OLEDs use a single glass or plastic panel whereas LCDs use two glass panels; the thickness of the panels increases with size but
 the increase is more noticeable on LCDs) and potentially lower power consumption (as the display is only "on" where needed and there
 is no backlight). OLEDs, however, are more expensive for a given display size due to the very expensive electroluminescent materials
 or phosphors that they use. Also due to the use of phosphors, OLEDs suffer from screen burn-in and there is currently no way to recycle
 OLED displays, whereas LCD panels can be recycled, although the technology required to recycle LCDs is not yet widespread.
 Attempts to maintain the competitiveness of LCDs are quantum dot displays, marketed as SUHD, QLED or Triluminos,
 which are LCD displays with blue LED backlighting and a Quantum-dot enhancement film (QDEF) that converts part of the blue light
 into red and green, offering similar performance to an OLED display at a lower price, but the quantum dot layer that gives these
 displays their characteristics can not yet be recycled.
Since LCD screens don't use phosphors, they rarely suffer image burn-in when a static image is displayed on a screen for a long time,
 e.g., the table frame for an airline flight schedule on an indoor sign. LCDs are, however, susceptible to image persistence.
 The LCD screen is more energy-efficient and can be disposed of more safely than a CRT can.
 Its low electrical power consumption enables it to be used in battery-powered electronic equipment more efficiently than a CRT can be.
 By 2008, annual sales of televisions with LCD screens exceeded sales of CRT units worldwide, and the CRT became obsolete for most purposes.

 Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips,
 embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.
Intel (integrated and electronics) was founded on July 18, 1968, by semiconductor pioneers Gordon Moore (of Moore's law) and Robert Noyce,
 and is associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove.
 Intel was a key component of the rise of Silicon Valley as a high-tech center.
 Noyce was a key inventor of the integrated circuit (microchip).[citation needed] Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips,
 which represented the majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971,
 it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its primary business.
During the 1990s, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry.
 During this period, Intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for PCs and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics
 in defense of its market position, particularly against Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control
 over the direction of the PC industry.
The Open Source Technology Center at Intel hosts PowerTOP and LatencyTOP, and supports other open-source projects such as Wayland,
 Mesa, Threading Building Blocks (TBB), and Xen.

A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool.
 Games are different from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of
aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work
 (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such
 as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).
Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well.
 They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. 
The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship.
 On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often,
 part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.
 A toy and a game are not the same. Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas games come with present rules.
Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction. Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both.
 Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role.
Attested as early as 2600 BC, games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures.
 The Royal Game of Ur, Senet, and Mancala are some of the oldest known games.

Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard
 (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.
 The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch
 towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over" being completed once they have legally done so six times.
 The batting side has one player at each end of the pitch, with the player at the opposite end of the pitch from the bowler
 aiming to strike the ball with a bat. The batting side scores runs either when the ball reaches the boundary of the field,
 or when the two batters swap ends of the pitch, which results in one run. The fielding side's aim is to prevent run-scoring
 and dismiss each batter (so they are "out", and are said to have "lost their wicket"). Means of dismissal include being bowled,
 when the bowled ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground,
 or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket to complete a run.
 When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a
 third umpire and match referee in international matches.
Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs and the game generally lasting three hours,
 to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club
 or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard,
 solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.
The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British
 Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket
 Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket,
 are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australasia, the United Kingdom,
 southern Africa and the West Indies.
Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard.
 The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day International trophies,
 including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.

World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., commonly shortened to its trade name WWE,
 is an American professional wrestling promotion. A global entertainment company, WWE has also branched out into other fields,
 including film, American football, and various other business ventures.
 The company is additionally involved in licensing its intellectual property to companies to produce video games and action figures.
The promotion was founded in 1953 as the Capitol Wrestling Corporation. It is the largest wrestling promotion in the world with its roster
 divided up into two primary touring groups and two developmental groups (referred to by WWE as "brands").
 Overall, WWE is available to 900 million homes worldwide in 28 languages. The company's global headquarters is located in Stamford,
 Connecticut, with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Mumbai, Shanghai, Singapore, Dubai and Munich.
As in other professional wrestling promotions, WWE shows are not legitimate contests but entertainment-based performance theater,
 featuring storyline-driven, scripted, and partially-choreographed matches; however, matches often include moves that can put
 performers at risk of injury, even death, if not performed correctly. The pre-determined aspect of professional wrestling was
 publicly acknowledged by WWE's owner Vince McMahon in 1989 in order to avoid taxes from athletic commissions.
 WWE brands its product as sports entertainment, acknowledging wrestling's roots in competitive sport and dramatic theater.
The company's majority owner is its chairman and CEO, third-generation wrestling promoter Vince McMahon,
 who retains a 37.6% ownership of the company's outstanding stock and 80.5% of the voting power.
 The current entity, which was originally named Titan Sports, Inc., was incorporated on February 21, 1980, in South Yarmouth,
 Massachusetts. It acquired Capitol Wrestling Corporation Ltd., the holding company for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), 
previously known as the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), in 1982. Titan was renamed World Wrestling Federation Entertainment,
 Inc. in 1999, and then World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. in 2002. Since 2011, the company has branded itself solely with the initials
 WWE, though the legal name has not changed since 2002.

A skill is the learned ability to perform an action with determined results with good execution often within a given amount of time,
 energy, or both. Skills can often be divided into domain-general and domain-specific skills.
 For example, in the domain of work, some general skills would include time management, teamwork and leadership,
 self-motivation and others, whereas domain-specific skills would be used only for a certain job. Skill usually requires certain environmental
 stimuli and situations to assess the level of skill being shown and used.
A skill may be called an art when it represents a body of knowledge or branch of learning,
 as in the art of medicine or the art of war. Although the arts are also skills, there are many skills that form an art but have no
 connect the human body is the fish that swims in the water!
People need a broad range of skills to contribute to the modern economy.
 A joint ASTD and U.S. Department of Labor study showed that through technology, the workplace is changing,
 and identified 16 basic skills that employees must have to be able to change with it.
 Three broad categories of skills are suggested and these are technical, human, and conceptual.
 The first two can be substituted with hard and soft skills, respectively.

A habit is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.
The American Journal of Psychology (1903) defined a "habit, from the standpoint of psychology,
 a more or less fixed way of thinking, willing, or feeling acquired through previous repetition of a mental experience."
 Habitual behavior often goes unnoticed in persons exhibiting it, because a person does not need to engage in self-analysis when
 undertaking routine tasks. Habits are sometimes compulsory. A 2002 daily experience study by habit researcher Wendy Wood and her
 colleagues found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through
 the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns 
which humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.
When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action.
 This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency;
 lack of awareness; unintentionality; and uncontrollability.

Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior. Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena,
 including feelings and thoughts. It is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the natural and social sciences.
 Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline to neuroscience.
 As social scientists, psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups. 
psi is a Greek letter which is commonly associated with the science of psychology.
A professional practitioner or researcher involved in the discipline is called a psychologist. 
Some psychologists can also be classified as behavioral or cognitive scientists. 
Some psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior.
 Others explore the physiological and neurobiological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.
Psychologists are involved in research on perception, cognition, attention, emotion, intelligence, subjective experiences,
 motivation, brain functioning, and personality. Psychologists' interests extend to interpersonal relationships, psychological resilience,
 family resilience, and other areas within social psychology. They also consider the unconscious mind.
 Research psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables.
 Some, but not all, clinical and counseling psychologists rely on symbolic interpretation.
While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems,
 it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. 
By many accounts, psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. Many psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role,
 practicing psychotherapy in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Other psychologists conduct scientific research on a wide range of
 topics related to mental processes and behavior. Typically the latter group of psychologists work in academic settings
 (e.g., universities, medical schools, or hospitals). Another group of psychologists is employed in industrial and organizational settings.
 Yet others are involved in work on human development, aging, sports, health, forensic science, education, and the media.

Hindi, or more precisely Modern Standard Hindi, is an Indo-Aryan language spoken chiefly in the Hindi belt region encompassing parts
 of northern, central, eastern and western India. Hindi has been described as a standardised and Sanskritised register
 of the Hindustani language, which itself is based primarily on the Khariboli dialect of Delhi and neighbouring areas of Northern India.
 Hindi, written in the Devanagari script, is one of the two official languages of the Government of India, along with English.
 It is an official language in 9 States and 3 Union Territories and an additional official language in 3 other states.
 Hindi is also one of the 22 scheduled languages of the Republic of India.
Hindi is the lingua franca of the Hindi Belt. It is also spoken, to a lesser extent, in other parts of India
 (usually in a simplified or pidginised variety such as Bazaar Hindustani or Haflong Hindi).
 Outside India, several other languages are recognised officially as "Hindi" but do not refer to the Standard Hindi language
 described here and instead descend from other dialects, such as Awadhi and Bhojpuri.
 Such languages include Fiji Hindi, which is official in Fiji, and Caribbean Hindustani,
 which is spoken in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. Apart from the script and formal vocabulary,
 standard Hindi is mutually intelligible with Standard Urdu, another recognised register of Hindustani as both share a common colloquial base.
As a linguistic variety, Hindi is the fourth most-spoken first language in the world, after Mandarin, Spanish and English.
 Hindi alongside Urdu as Hindustani is the third most-spoken language in the world, after Mandarin and English.

French is a Romance language of the Indo-European family. It descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire,
 as did all Romance languages. French evolved from Gallo-Romance, the Latin spoken in Gaul, and more specifically in Northern Gaul.
 Its closest relatives are the other langues d'oïl—languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium, which French
 (Francien) largely supplanted. French was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul like Gallia Belgica and by the
 (Germanic) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders. Today, owing to France's past overseas expansion,
 there are numerous French-based creole languages, most notably Haitian Creole.
 A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as Francophone in both English and French.
French is an official language in 29 countries across multiple continents, most of which are members of the Organisation internationale
 de la Francophonie (OIF), the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French.
 French is also one of six official languages used in the United Nations.
 It is spoken as a first language (in descending order of the number of speakers) in: France; Canada (especially in the provinces of Quebec,
 Ontario, and New Brunswick, as well as other Francophone regions); Belgium (Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region); western Switzerland
 (specifically the cantons forming the Romandy region); parts of Luxembourg; parts of the United States (the states of Louisiana, Maine,
 New Hampshire and Vermont); Monaco; the Aosta Valley region of Italy; and various communities elsewhere.
In 2015, approximately 40% of the francophone population (including L2 and partial speakers)
 lived in Europe, 36% in sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian Ocean, 15% in North Africa and the Middle East,
 8% in the Americas, and 1% in Asia and Oceania.[6] French is the second most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union.
 Of Europeans who speak other languages natively, approximately one-fifth are able to speak French as a second language.
 French is the second most taught foreign language in the EU. All institutions of the EU use French as a working language along with
 English and German; in certain institutions, French is the sole working language (e.g. at the Court of Justice of the European Union).
 French is also the 18th most natively spoken language in the world, sixth most spoken language by total number of speakers and the second
 or third most studied language worldwide (with about 120 million learners as of 2017).
 As a result of French and Belgian colonialism from the 16th century onward, French was introduced to new territories in the Americas,
 Africa and Asia. Most second-language speakers reside in Francophone Africa, in particular Gabon, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Mauritius,
 Senegal and Ivory Coast.
French is estimated to have about 76 million native speakers; about 235 million daily, fluent speakers;
 and another 77–110 million secondary speakers who speak it as a second language to varying degrees of proficiency, mainly in Africa.
 According to the OIF, approximately 321 million people worldwide are "able to speak the language",
 without specifying the criteria for this estimation or whom it encompasses. According to a demographic projection led by the Université
 Laval and the Réseau Démographie de l'Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, the total number of French speakers will reach approximately
 500 million in 2025 and 650 million by 2050. OIF estimates 700 million by 2050, 80% of whom will be in Africa.
French has a long history as an international language of literature and scientific standards and is a primary
 or second language of many international organisations including the United Nations, the European Union, the North Atlantic
 Treaty Organization, the World Trade Organization, the International Olympic Committee, and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
 In 2011, Bloomberg Businessweek ranked French the third most useful language for business, after English and Standard Mandarin Chinese.

Spanish is a Romance language of the Indo-European language family that evolved from colloquial spoken Latin in the Iberian Peninsula of Europe.
 Today, it is a global language with nearly 500 million native speakers, mainly in the Americas and Spain.
 It is the world's second-most spoken native language after Mandarin Chinese; the world's fourth-most spoken language overall after English,
 Mandarin Chinese, and Hindi; and the world's most widely spoken Romance language.
Spanish is part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages, which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after
 the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern
 Iberia in the 9th century, and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo,
 a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile, in the 13th century. Modern Spanish was then taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish
 Empire beginning in 1492, most notably to the Americas, as well as territories in Africa and Asia.
As a Romance language, Spanish is a descendant of Latin and has one of the smaller degrees of difference from it
 (about 20%) alongside Sardinian and Italian. Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin,
 including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek. Alongside English and French, it is also one of the most taught foreign
 languages throughout the world. Spanish does not feature prominently as a scientific language; however,
 it is better represented in areas like humanities and social sciences. Spanish is also the third most used language on internet websites
 after English and Chinese. Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations, and it is also used as an official
 language by the European Union, the Organization of American States, the Union of South American Nations, the Community of Latin
 American and Caribbean States, the African Union and many other international organizations.

Japanese is an East Asian language spoken by about 128 million people, primarily in Japan, where it is the national language.
 It is a member of the Japonic language family, and its ultimate derivation and relation to other languages is unclear.
 Japonic languages have been grouped with other language families such as Ainu, Austroasiatic, Korean, and the now-discredited Altaic,
 but none of these proposals have gained widespread acceptance.
Little is known of the language's prehistory, or when it first appeared in Japan.
 Chinese documents from the 3rd century AD recorded a few Japanese words, but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century.
 During the Heian period in Japan, the Chinese language had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese.
 Late Middle Japanese included changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language, and the first appearance of European loanwords.
 The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region in the south, up to the Edo region  in the Early Modern Japanese period
 (early 17th century–mid 19th century). Following the end of Japan's self-imposed isolation in 1853, the flow of loanwords from 
European languages increased significantly. English loanwords, in particular, have become frequent, and Japanese words from English
 roots have proliferated.
Japanese is an agglutinative, mora-timed language with relatively simple phonotactics,
 a pure vowel system, phonemic vowel and consonant length, and a lexically significant pitch-accent. 
Word order is normally subject–object–verb with particles marking the grammatical function of words, and sentence structure is topic–comment.
 Sentence-final particles are used to add emotional or emphatic impact, or make questions.
 Nouns have no grammatical number or gender, and there are no articles. Verbs are conjugated, primarily for tense and voice, but not person.
 Japanese adjectives are also conjugated. Japanese has a complex system of honorifics, with verb forms and vocabulary to indicate
 the relative status of the speaker, the listener, and persons mentioned.
Japanese has no demonstrable genealogical relationship with Chinese, though in its written form it makes prevalent use of Chinese characters,
 known as kanji, and a large portion of its vocabulary is borrowed from Chinese.
 The Japanese writing system also uses two syllabic (or moraic) scripts: hiragana  and katakana ,
 however Latin script is used in a limited fashion (such as for imported acronyms).
 The numeral system uses mostly Arabic numerals, but also traditional Chinese numerals.

A festival is an event ordinarily celebrated by a community and centering on some characteristic aspect of that community and its 
religion or cultures. It is often marked as a local or national holiday, mela, or eid. A festival constitutes typical cases of glocalization,
 as well as the high culture-low culture interrelationship. Next to religion and folklore, a significant origin is agricultural.
 Food is such a vital resource that many festivals are associated with harvest time.
 Religious commemoration and thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in events that take place in autumn,
 such as Halloween in the northern hemisphere and Easter in the southern.
Festivals often serve to fulfill specific communal purposes, especially in regard to commemoration or thanking to the gods,
 goddesses or saints: they're called patronal festivals. They may also provide entertainment, which was particularly important to local
 communities before the advent of mass-produced entertainment. Festivals that focus on cultural or ethnic topics also seek to 
inform community members of their traditions; the involvement of elders sharing stories and experience provides a means for unity among families.
In Ancient Greece and Rome, festivals such as the Saturnalia were closely associated with social organisation and political processes
 as well as religion.
